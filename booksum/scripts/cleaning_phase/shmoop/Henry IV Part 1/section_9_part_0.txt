Why else, asks King Henry, would a prince act like such a total loser?<PARAGRAPH>Hal asks for forgiveness and hints that he'll \"purge\" himself of his bad behavior. <PARAGRAPH>The king launches into a long list of why Hal's such a degenerate: Hal's been kicked out of the council and replaced by his little brother, he's alienated himself from the nobles at court, he's let down just about everyone who ever had high expectations of him, and everybody thinks he's on a major downward spiral.<PARAGRAPH>The king gives Hal some advice about how to manage his public image and tells him to quit hanging out with the commoners because it's bad public relations.<PARAGRAPH>Unlike King Richard II, the \"skipping king,\" who was a total clown and didn't know how to keep his public image fresh, King Henry knows how to keep his subjects loyal.<PARAGRAPH>Prince Hal promises to be good.<PARAGRAPH>But, Henry's not done. He compares Hal to Hotspur and says , \"Why can't you be more like that guy?
