{"name": "Act I", "summary": "Regina Engstrand, a young girl in service for Mrs. Alving, appears in the garden. She tries to prevent her father, Jacob Engstrand, from entering. The rain makes the old man even more disreputable looking than usual, and Regina makes it clear she is ashamed of his coarseness and vulgar appearance. Engstrand has come to ask Regina to live with him and work for him in his planned \"seamen's home.\" He says he has saved enough money from doing carpentry work on the new orphanage to begin this enterprise and now that she has grown into \"such a fine wench\" she would be a valuable asset. He clearly implies that this seamen's home will be a high class brothel. Regina says she has her own plans for the future, especially since Oswald Alving has just returned from his studies in Paris.\nPastor Manders enters after Engstrand has left. He talks with Regina about her father. Since Engstrand requires a strong influence to keep him from drinking, Manders suggests that Regina, out of filial duty, return to live with him and be \"the guiding hand\" in her father's life. Regina says she would rather seek a place in town as a governess.\nWhile the girl goes to fetch Mrs. Alving, Manders peruses some books on the table. He gives a start after reading the title page of one, and with increasing disapproval looks at some others. Cordially and affectionately, Mrs. Alving comes in to greet him. Politely inquiring after Oswald, Manders then asks who reads these books. Shocked to find they are hers, he wonders how such readings could contribute to her feeling of self-reliance, as she puts it, or how they can confirm her own impressions. What is objectionable about the books, she asks. \"I have read quite enough about them to disapprove of them,\" he answers. \"But your own opinion \u2014 \" she pursues. He talks as if to a child:\nMy dear Mrs. Alving, there are many occasions in life when one has to rely on the opinions of others. That is the way in the world, and it is quite right that it should be so. What would become of society otherwise?\nHe now wishes to discuss their mutual business \u2014 the Captain Alving Orphanage \u2014 built by Mrs. Alving in honor of her late husband. Although she has left all the arrangements to Manders, he wants to ask whether they should insure the buildings. To her prompt \"of course,\" he raises objections since the orphanage is dedicated to \"higher causes.\" He points out that his fellow clergymen and their congregations might interpret the insurance to mean \"that neither you nor I had a proper reliance on Divine protection.\" As Mrs. Alving's advisor he himself would be the first attacked by \"spiteful persons\" who would publicly slander him. She assures him that under these conditions she would not wish the buildings insured.\nSpeaking of insurance, Mrs. Alving mentions that the building nearly caught fire yesterday from some burning shavings in the carpenter's shop. She says she has heard that Engstrand is often careless with matches. Manders makes excuses because the \"poor fellow\" has so many anxieties. \"Heaven be thanked,\" he says, \"I am told he is really making an effort to live a blameless life. Why he assured me so himself.\" Manders thinks it would be best for Engstrand if Regina returned to live with him, but Mrs. Alving's firm \"No!\" is definitive.\nOswald appears, bearing so much likeness to his dead father that Manders is startled; Mrs. Alving quickly insists that her son takes after her. During their conversation, Oswald shocks the pastor by depicting the fidelity and beauty of family life among the common-law marriages of his fellow painters in Paris. Disapproving of artists in the first place, Manders sputters indignantly at such circles \"where open immorality is rampant.\" He cannot understand how \"the authorities would tolerate such things\" and is even more dismayed when Mrs. Alving later declares that Oswald \"was right in every single word he said.\" In her loneliness, she continues, she has come to the same conclusions as her son, that the married men of good social standing are capable of the greatest acts of immorality.\nIt is his duty to speak now, but not just as a friend, Manders says, \"it is your priest that stands before you just as he once did at the most critical moment of your life.\" He reminds her how she came to him after the first year of marriage, refusing to return to her husband. She softly reminds him that the first year was \"unspeakably unhappy.\" To crave for happiness is simply to be \"possessed by a spirit of revolt,\" he answers. Bound in marriage by a \"sacred bond\" her duty was \"to cleave to the man you had chosen\"; though a husband be profligate, a wife's duty is to bear the cross laid upon her shoulders by \"a higher will,\" Manders continues. It was imprudent for her to have sought refuge with him at the time, and he is proud to have had the strength of character to lead her back \"to the path of duty\" and back to her husband.\nHaving defaulted in her wifely duty, she also neglected her duty as a mother, Manders goes on. Because she sent Oswald to boarding schools all his life rather than educating him at home, the child has become a thorough profligate. \"In very truth, Mrs. Alving, you are a guilty mother!\" Manders exhorts.\nThese conclusions are unjust, Mrs. Alving answers, for Manders knew nothing of her life from that moment on. He must know now \"that my husband died just as great a profligate as he had been all his life.\" In fact, she tells him, a disease he contracted from his lifelong excesses caused his death. Manders gropes for a chair. To think that all the years of her wedded life were nothing but \"a hidden abyss of misery\" makes his brain reel. She says that her husband's scandalous conduct invaded the walls of this very house for she witnessed Alving's approaches to the servant Joanna. \"My husband had his will of that girl,\" Mrs. Alving continues, \"and that intimacy had consequences.\" Only later on does Manders discover that the \"consequences\" are Regina.\nMrs. Alving goes on to describe how she sat up with her husband during his drinking bouts, being his companion so he would not leave the house to seek others. She had to listen to his ribald talk and then, with brute force, bring him to bed. She endured all this for Oswald's sake, sending him to boarding schools when he was old enough to ask questions. As long as his father was alive, Oswald never set foot in his home.\nBesides thoughts of her son, she also had her work to sustain her, Mrs. Alving tells Manders. Too besotted to be useful, her husband depended on her to keep him in touch with his work during his lucid intervals. She improved and arranged all his properties, and she is converting his share of the estate into the \"Captain Alving Orphanage.\" By this gesture Mrs. Alving hopes to \"silence all rumors and clear away all doubt\" as to the truth of her husband's life. None of his father's estate shall pass on to Oswald; \"my son shall have everything from me,\" she states.\nGrumbling at \"this everlasting rain,\" Oswald returns from his walk. When Regina announces that dinner is ready, Oswald follows her into the dining room to uncork the wines. Meanwhile Manders and Mrs. Alving discuss the dedication ceremony for the opening of the orphanage tomorrow. She regards the occasion as the end of \"this long dreadful comedy.\" After tomorrow she shall feel as if the dead husband had never lived here. Then \"there will be no one else here but my boy and his mother,\" she declares. They hear a quiet scuffle from the next room, then Regina's whisper, \"Oswald! Are you mad? Let me go!\"\nHorror-struck, Mrs. Alving hoarsely whispers to Manders, \"Ghosts. The couple in the conservatory \u2014 over again.\" He is bewildered. Then knowledge dawns. \"What are you saying! Regina \u2014 ? Is she \u2014 ?\" His hostess nods helplessly. The curtain comes down.", "analysis": "As the first act functions to introduce the characters, the central problem of the play, as well as the essential story line, the playwright carefully forewarns his audience of the themes he will develop in subsequent acts. In fact, the first scene of a well written drama often presents a complete analogy of the whole play. With this in mind, the author imparts special significance to the order of appearance of his characters.\nRegina is the first to appear, showing by dress and demeanor that she is a properly reared servant maid. As she talks with her father, the audience recognizes that, though she is of vulgar stock, she has aspirations to gentility. This is shown as she uses her little knowledge of French.\nEngstrand's appearance keynotes the theme of a depraved parent who ensnares his child in his own dissolution, especially as the carpenter asks Regina to join him in his planned enterprise. Implying that she is not his true-born daughter, Ibsen also introduces the theme that children, although unaware of their origins, inherit qualities from their parents. As Regina accuses her father of being able to \"humbug\" the reverend, and later on showing how Manders accepts Engstrand's hypocrisy for fact, Ibsen introduces the idea that society recognizes phrase-mongering rather than integrity of thought and action as a standard of moral respectability.\nPastor Manders appears next; suggesting that Regina return to live with her father shows how he allies himself with Jacob Engstrand. The respectability and social orthodoxy which he expresses in phrases like \"daughter's duty\" rather than defining his principles through thoughtful investigations, show that Manders supports anyone whose cant agrees with his own.\nAfter Manders peruses the books, Mrs. Alving enters. The audience senses that she is separated from the pastor by an abyss created by her intellect and experience, as symbolized by the books. Arranged on the table which stands between them, these volumes are in fact their first subject of dissension. One does not have to read them to denounce them, Manders states. He is content to accept the opinions of others. By her answers, Mrs. Alving shows she is no longer satisfied by dogma; she must learn truth through her own experience.\nSince Manders indicates no ability to learn anything not expressed in pious formulas, we cannot expect his character to change during the drama. Mrs. Alving, on the other hand, welcoming controversy and opposing the results of her experience to what she has always been taught, is fully prepared to face the full impact of events forthcoming in the rest of the play. This quality marks Mrs. Alving as the protagonist of the drama. Having established these intellectual qualities of the mother, Ibsen now brings forth Oswald. As the entire product of Mrs. Alving's life, he presents the greatest problem she will confront.\nThis arrangement of character introduction suggests the opposing tensions of the play. Regina, her dead mother, and Engstrand parallel Oswald, his mother, and the dead Mr. Alving. One side represents that part of society whose members have loose morals, aspirations to gentility, and who grab at whatever opportunity for self-betterment they can; the other side represents the best in society, a group whose members are cultured, propertied, and have strong ethics. In the middle, as if he were a fulcrum balancing the extremes, stands Pastor Manders. Already appearing as a moralizing but empty-headed standard of society, denouncing Mrs. Alving's intellectual inquiry and supporting Engstrand's hypocrisy, the character of Manders allows the audience to foresee the thesis of the drama: that a society which unwittingly destroys individuality and encourages deceit perpetrates disease \u2014 physical as well as emotional \u2014 upon its youthful members.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201201091635/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/g/ghosts/summary-and-analysis/act-i"}
