She shows them a note signed with John Brooke's name, confessing his passion for her and asking her how she feels about him.<PARAGRAPH>Jo swears that she didn't write this note or play a trick on Meg.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. March asks Meg if she answered this first note. Meg says that she did, and that she said that she was too young to think about getting attached, and that she didn't want to hide anything from her parents, and that he should talk to her father.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. March is pleased with Meg's modest response and tells her that she did the right thing.<PARAGRAPH>Meg tells her mother and Jo that the second note, also signed by John Brooke, says that he didn't send her any love letter and thinks that Jo must have forged it.<PARAGRAPH>Meg is in despair, but when Jo examines the two notes, she thinks that they are both forgeries by Laurie and that John Brooke doesn't know anything about it.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. March sends Jo to get Laurie.
