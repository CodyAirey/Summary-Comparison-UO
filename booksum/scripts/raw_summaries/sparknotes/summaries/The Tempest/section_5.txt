See Important Quotations Explained  Back at Prospero\u2019s cell, Ferdinand takes over Caliban\u2019s duties and carries wood for Prospero. Unlike Caliban, however, Ferdinand has no desire to curse. Instead, he enjoys his labors because they serve the woman he loves, Miranda. As Ferdinand works and thinks of Miranda, she enters, and after her, unseen by either lover, Prospero enters. Miranda tells Ferdinand to take a break from his work, or to let her work for him, thinking that her father is away. Ferdinand refuses to let her work for him but does rest from his work and asks Miranda her name. She tells him, and he is pleased: \u201cMiranda\u201d comes from the same Latin word that gives English the word \u201cadmiration.\u201d Ferdinand\u2019s speech plays on the etymology: \u201cAdmired Miranda! / Indeed the top of admiration, worth / What\u2019s dearest to the world!\u201d (III.i.37\u201339). Ferdinand goes on to flatter his beloved. Miranda is, of course, modest, pointing out that she has no idea of any woman\u2019s face but her own. She goes on to praise Ferdinand\u2019s face, but then stops herself, remembering her father\u2019s instructions that she should not speak to Ferdinand. Ferdinand assures Miranda that he is a prince and probably a king now, though he prays his father is not dead. Miranda seems unconcerned with Ferdinand\u2019s title, and asks only if he loves her. Ferdinand replies enthusiastically that he does, and his response emboldens Miranda to propose marriage. Ferdinand accepts and the two part. Prospero comes forth, subdued in his happiness, for he has known that this would happen. He then hastens to his book of magic in order to prepare for remaining business.

See Important Quotations Explained  This scene revolves around different images of servitude. Ferdinand is literally in service to Prospero, but in order to make his labor more pleasant he sees Miranda as his taskmaster. When he talks to Miranda, Ferdinand brings up a different kind of servitude\u2014the love he has felt for a number of other beautiful women. Ferdinand sees this love, in comparison to his love for Miranda, as an enforced servitude: \u201cFull many a lady / I have eyed with the best regard, and many a time / Th\u2019 harmony of their tongues hath into bondage / Brought my too diligent ear\u201d (III.i.39\u201342). When Miranda stops the conversation momentarily, remembering her father\u2019s command against talking to Ferdinand, the prince hastens to assure her that he is worthy of her love. He is royalty, he says, and in normal life \u201cwould no more endure / This wooden slavery [carrying logs] than to suffer / The flesh-fly blow my mouth\u201d (III.i.61\u201363). But this slavery is made tolerable by a different kind of slavery: \u201cThe very instant that I saw you did / My heart fly to your service; there resides, / To make me slave to it\u201d (III.i.64\u201366). The words \u201cslavery\u201d and \u201cslave\u201d underscore the parallel as well as the difference between Ferdinand and Caliban. Prospero repeatedly calls Caliban a slave, and we see Caliban as a slave both to Prospero and to his own anger. Ferdinand, on the other hand, is a willing slave to his love, happy in a servitude that makes him rejoice rather than curse. At the end of the scene, Miranda takes up the theme of servitude. Proposing marriage to Ferdinand, she says that \u201cI am your wife, if you will marry me; / If not, I\u2019ll die your maid. . . . / You may deny me; but I\u2019ll be your servant / Whether you will or no\u201d (III.i.83\u201386). This is the only scene of actual interaction we see between Ferdinand and Miranda. Miranda is, as we know, and as she says, very innocent: \u201cI do not know / One of my sex, no woman\u2019s face remember / Save from my glass mine own; nor have I seen / More that I may call men than you, good friend, / And my dear father\u201d (III.i.48\u201352). The play has to make an effort to overcome the implausibility of this courtship\u2014to make Miranda look like something more than Prospero\u2019s puppet and a fool for the first man she sees. Shakespeare accomplishes this by showing Ferdinand in one kind of servitude\u2014in which he must literally and physically humble himself\u2014as he talks earnestly about another kind of servitude, in which he gives himself wholly to Miranda. The fact that Miranda speaks of a similar servitude of her own accord, that she remembers her father\u2019s \u201cprecepts\u201d and then disregards them, and that Prospero remains in the background without interfering helps the audience to trust this meeting between the lovers more than their first meeting in Act I, scene ii. Of course, Prospero\u2019s presence in the first place may suggest that he is somehow in control of what Miranda does or says. At the end he steps forward to assure the audience that he knew what would happen: \u201cSo glad of this as they I cannot be, / Who are surprised with all\u201d (III.i.93\u201394). But Prospero\u2019s five other lines (III.i.31\u201332 and III.i.74\u201376) do not suggest that he controls what Miranda says. Rather, he watches in the manner of a father\u2014both proud of his daughter\u2019s choice and slightly sad to see her grow up.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210131162607/https://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/tempest/section6/"}
