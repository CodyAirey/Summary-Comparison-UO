{"name": "Chapter 10", "summary": "PARAGRAPH>Chapter 10 Summary: May and Newland go for a walk in the park. May thanks him for sending her flowers every day and remarks that it is nice that she gets them at different times of the day; it means he thinks each day to send her flowers, unlike Larry Lefferts who had a standing order for Gertrude1s flowers to be sent each day. Newland tells May that he sent Ellen beautiful roses but May remarks that Ellen had not discussed them, although she had discussed flowers from other friends. Newland changes the subject and remarks that their engagement seems very long; May says that everyone else has had similarly long engagements. Newland feels like all of May1s comments have been fed to her by others and wonders how long it will be until she can speak for herself. He worries that when he takes her bandage of innocence off her eyes, she won1t be able to see anything. He suggests that they travel and May remarks that he is terribly original. Then Newland shouts, \"Original. We1re all like each other as those dolls cut out of the same folded paper. On the suggestion of elopement, May balks, \"We can1t behave like people in novels, though, can we. PARAGRAPH>Later, Archer skips his regular trip to the club for fear that his life is becoming to repetitive and predictable. While he is reading novels in his study, Janey tells him that the Countess has gone to a party at Mrs. Struthers. This is horrible, of course, because Struthers is too \"common. Newland remarks that he is \"not married to Countess Olenska\" and has nothing to do with her affairs. Luckily, Henry van der Luyden comes for a visit and does not blame Ellen for her attending the party. She probably just doesn1t understand convention. Henry1s nonchalance about the affair puts Mrs. Archer1s heart at ease: decorum is still intact. PARAGRAPH>Analysis: Here we see a deepening of Newland1s infatuation with Ellen. He vocalizes \"I1m not engaged to be married to the Countess Olenska\" as if he is truly voicing his own desire. He also says, \"Ellen was the best looking woman \" without even considering May. PARAGRAPH>Also important is the theme of reading in this novel; perhaps Newland is getting his fantastic ideas about what romance and love should be like from his novels. Are the novels to blame for his love of the \"exotic\" and his infatuation with Ellen. Does May recognize Newland1s new literature-induced impulses. Is this why she says, \"We can1t live like people in novels\". PARAGRAPH>Also, the fungibility of decorum is displayed in this chapter. Mrs. Archer is totally afraid that Ellen1s behavior is out of place, but when Henry van der Luyden is ready to place the blame for her actions on the Duke, Ellen1s actions are vindicated. We see that morality in this society is quite flexible and dependent upon what those in \"power\" dictate", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210416073116/http://www.gradesaver.com/the-age-of-innocence/study-guide/summary-chapters-6-10"}
