The Governess spills the beans about the strange man; she tells the housekeeper about both encounters with him.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Grose questions the Governess about this man. They establish that he is certainly not a gentleman; in the words of the Governess, \"He's a horror\" (5.11).<PARAGRAPH>The Governess decides not to go to church, as she's afraid to leave the children alone at the house with the mystery man lurking around.<PARAGRAPH>The two women discuss the man's appearances further, wondering what his intentions were, how he got the house the first time, and what he will do in the future.<PARAGRAPH>The Governess finally gives a description of the face she saw; he's red-haired, handsome, has piercing eyes, and, as she says, he looks like an actor.<PARAGRAPH>She also claims that he's wearing someone else's nice clothes, though how she knows this, we have no idea. She reiterates her certainty that he's no gentleman.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Grose can't contain herself \u2013 she obviously knows this man. She affirms the fact that they're not his clothes, they're the master's. We get a name for the mysterious intruder, Peter Quint.<PARAGRAPH>Apparently, Quint was the master's valet when he lived at Bly. After the master left the country to return to London, Quint stayed on, and was in charge of the household.
