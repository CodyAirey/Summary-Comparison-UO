{"name": "Chapter 22", "summary": "The narrator introduces us to a new scene near Florence, now six months after Mr. Touchett\u2019s death. The narrator describes the fa\u00e7ade of this house as an impenetrable mask, not a face.<PARAGRAPH>Two nuns, Gilbert Osmond, and his fifteen-year-old daughter Pansy are sitting in Mr. Osmond\u2019s house. Pansy has just returned from a convent school, and the nuns are sad to see her go. Apparently, she was a model pupil.<PARAGRAPH>Gilbert Osmond has been showing them his painting.<PARAGRAPH>Pansy has not seen her father in a while. He is surprised by her growth and her beauty.<PARAGRAPH>Pansy and Gilbert Osmond are multi-lingual and pan-European \u2013 they speak French, Italian, and English.<PARAGRAPH>Gilbert Osmond asks Pansy to collect flowers for the nuns outside. Pansy happily obeys, which seems to be her general modus operandi.<PARAGRAPH>Gilbert Osmond hasn\u2019t decided whether Pansy will return to the convent or not. The understanding is that she is made for the world, not for the nunnery.<PARAGRAPH>Pansy comes back with bouquets of white and red flowers.<PARAGRAPH>Osmond is about to show the nuns out when he sees someone entering the grounds: a familiar character, Madame Merle.<PARAGRAPH>Pansy is happy to see Madame Merle. She remembers how Madame Merle visited her while she was in the convent.<PARAGRAPH>Madame Merle asks Osmond why he did not visit her in Florence.<PARAGRAPH>Osmond walks the nuns out, and Madame Merle asks that Pansy stay with her instead of seeing her surrogate mothers off. Pansy obeys.<PARAGRAPH>Madame Merle compliments Pansy on being obedient and for wearing gloves. She promises to buy Pansy a dozen multicolored pairs of gloves.<PARAGRAPH>Pansy says that she is fond of pretty things, but, sensibly, not too fond.<PARAGRAPH>Madame Merle and Osmond talk as though Pansy was not in the room. Osmond finally asks her to go outside to pick flowers for Madame Merle.<PARAGRAPH>Madame Merle tells Osmond that she wants to introduce him to Isabel Archer. She wants Osmond to visit her at Mrs. Touchett\u2019s in Florence, where he will be able to meet Isabel.<PARAGRAPH>Osmond seems unmoved to do any such thing. He is lazy, and content with his life as it is.<PARAGRAPH>It\u2019s been a while since Osmond has made any new friends. He doesn\u2019t get out much.<PARAGRAPH>Madame Merle convinces Osmond that Isabel is better than even Madame Merle, since she is clever, beautiful, and rich.<PARAGRAPH>Madame Merle wants Osmond to marry Isabel.<PARAGRAPH>Osmond says that Madame Merle is looking well, so she must have a good idea \u2013 that\u2019s when she looks her best.<PARAGRAPH>It slowly becomes clear that Madame Merle wants Osmond to meet Isabel purely for Osmond\u2019s benefit. She does not seem to have Isabel\u2019s best intentions in mind.<PARAGRAPH>Madame Merle accuses Osmond of being heartless, which he denies.<PARAGRAPH>Osmond brags about his painting, but Madame Merle is unimpressed. She concedes that he has good taste, though.<PARAGRAPH>Osmond can tolerate Mrs. Touchett, though he doesn\u2019t like Ralph.<PARAGRAPH>Madame Merle thinks that Pansy should not go back to the convent. Osmond still is not convinced.<PARAGRAPH>Pansy still has not returned with the flowers, and Madame Merle laments the fact that Pansy does not like her much.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210508161644/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/portrait-of-a-lady/summary/chapter-22"}
