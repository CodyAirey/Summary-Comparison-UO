The Tin Woodman, who think it's wrong for the cat to kill the mouse, kills the cat with his axe. Whoa, he's hardcore.<PARAGRAPH>The mouse, having avoided death, is super grateful. And as luck would have it, she's a queen. She orders her followers to do whatever the tin man wants.<PARAGRAPH>Uh-oh, Toto's up from his nap. And guess what? Little dogs love chasing mice. At least, this little dog does.<PARAGRAPH>The mice are afraid, but the tin man grabs Toto and assures them they will come to no harm.<PARAGRAPH>The mice wonder if there's anything they can do for their savior the tin man. He says nah, but the Scarecrow has an idea: they can help save the Lion!<PARAGRAPH>As per usual, the Scarecrow's plan involves the tin man making something. This time it's a truck.<PARAGRAPH>Here's how it will work: thousands of mouse helpers will each attach a single string to the truck. Then they'll drag it like an insane chariot to retrieve the Lion.<PARAGRAPH>The plan works, and the Lion is saved. Everyone's really grateful to the mouse queen. In parting, she tells them that they can call for her whenever they need help.<PARAGRAPH>Everyone sits around and chills while they wait for the Lion to wake up.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210617042157/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/wonderful-wizard-of-oz-book/summary/chapter-9"}
