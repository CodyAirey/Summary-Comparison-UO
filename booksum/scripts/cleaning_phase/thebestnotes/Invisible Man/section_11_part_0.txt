{"name": "chapter 11", "summary": "The narrator returns to consciousness in the factory laboratory. Several physicians \n        wander in and out, talking about him as if he is not there. He is strapped \n        down inside a glass box. At one point, the talk of treating the narrator \n        turns to lobotomies and experimental electric shock therapy. The procedure \n        is painful, taking him in and out of consciousness. Eventually, the narrator \n        has totally forgotten his own identity; he wonders if he will be set free \n        once he remembers who he is. However, the doctors ask him his name, and \n        when he doesnt know, they let him go. He leaves the hospital and wonders \n        out into the Harlem streets.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025232/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Invisible_Man_Ellison/Invisible_Man_Study_Guide12.html"}
