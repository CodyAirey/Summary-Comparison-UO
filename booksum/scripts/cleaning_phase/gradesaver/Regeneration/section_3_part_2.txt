Wells, the famous science-fiction author. Owen and Sassoon continue discussing poetry and Sassoon gives Owen one of his poems to publish in the Hydra. He tells Owen about how Dr. Rivers has been pushing him to envision the future in order to make him feel guilty about being at Craiglockhart. Sassoon admits to being intimidated by the psychologist, who has more education than he does. Owen shares that he imagines himself becoming a pig farmer after the war, but then feels embarrassed about his humble ambition in front of the aristocratic Sassoon. PARAGRAPH>Owen nervously hands over a sheaf of his poems. He explains that his own psychologist believes that the war disconnects men from society and nature.

Sassoon helps Owen edit some of his poems line by line, patiently encouraging the younger man to spend more time honing his craft.
