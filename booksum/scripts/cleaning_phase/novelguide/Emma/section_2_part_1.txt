{"name": "volume 1, Chapter 7", "summary": "Chapter 7: The very day that Mr. Elton sets off for London, Harriet receives a letter proposing marriage from Mr. Martin and runs to Emma to find out what she should do. Emma finds the letter better than she had expected, but is surprised when she realizes that Harriet is thinking about what she ought to answer. Emma says that she will not give Harriet any advice on the matter, but adds that if Harriet has any doubts about it, she ought to refuse. Harriet cannot seem to make this decision by herself, and hesitantly says that she has almost determined to refuse him. Emma is immediately relieved, saying that she has made the right decision, and that she is glad, as they could no longer be friends if she married Mr. Martin. Harriet writes a letter refusing Martin, and Emma tries to make Harriet feel better about not being able to visit Mr. Martin's sisters anymore. Emma tries to get her to think of Mr. Elton instead, saying that he is probably showing her portrait to his mother and sisters", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210421073237/http://www.novelguide.com/emma/summaries/chap7-9"}
