{"name": "volume 1, Chapter 6", "summary": "Chapter 6: The next day the girls get up and dress, but there is no washing, as the water in the basins had frozen overnight. It is very cold in the school, and when Jane gets her porridge, while it is not burnt, it is a small portion. Jane is enrolled in the fourth class, and at first finds it hard, as she is not used to learning by heart. Later when she is sewing, she notices that her new friend is under constant observation by the teacher, and is then hit with a bunch of twigs on her neck. During the play hour Jane finds her friend, whose name she learns is Helen Burns. Jane tells her that she would not be able to take the teachers' punishments so quietly, but Helen tells her that they are only trying to correct her faults, and that they should return good for evil, as the Bible says. They talk more of the teachers, and Jane tells Helen of her sufferings at Gateshead", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201020200836/https://www.novelguide.com/jane-eyre/summaries/chap5-6"}
