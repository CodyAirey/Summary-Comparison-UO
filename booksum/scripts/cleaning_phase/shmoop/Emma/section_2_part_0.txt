Highbury has the Bateses . Don't worry about getting them mixed up: they're supposed to be pretty interchangeable at first.<PARAGRAPH>The Bateses always come to the Woodhouses' parties, if only because Miss Bates loves to gossip, which makes her a perfect companion for Mr. Woodhouse.<PARAGRAPH>At this particular party, Mrs. Goddard, the head of a local girl's school, asks to present her star pupil to Emma.<PARAGRAPH>Harriet Smith is seventeen. She's pretty and almost-smart - which makes her a perfect sidekick.<PARAGRAPH>No one knows who Harriet's parents are, although the narrator throws in an ironic observation that she must be somebody's daughter.<PARAGRAPH>Emma promptly decides that Harriet will be her new \"project.\"<PARAGRAPH>After all, a girl's got to have someone to help - and after Emma's through, she's sure that Harriet will be fit for \"good society\"!", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210116113822/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/emma/summary/chapter-three"}
