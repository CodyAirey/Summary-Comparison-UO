{"name": "Chapter 14", "summary": "PARAGRAPH>Chapter 14<PARAGRAPH>In this chapter, the reader, for the first time, meets Cacambo, a servant/friend of sorts to Candide who has come from Spain. Fleeing the authorities who are in the process of boarding the ship, Candide and Cacambo hurriedly flee to Paraguay, though Candide regrets having to leave his lover behind. As they enter the country, Cacambo explains to Candide that Paraguay is owned and run by the Jesuits, Los Padres. According to Camambo, Paraguay is a utopia. Los Padres are reasonable and just, though they are at war with the Spaniards in this hemisphere and \"send them to heaven\" in Europe. Here, obviously, Voltaire satirizes the Jesuits for their hypocritical and corrupt religious war, as they slaughter in the New World the very people they baptize and bury in the Old World. As Candide and his servant enter a Jesuit outpost of some kind, the guards arrest the pair, treating them almost as prisoners. When they realize that Candide is German, however, the soldiers quickly change their tune, instead treating Candide and his friend like royalty. Having been taken to their commander, Candide soon realizes that this man is the baron's son, Cungonde's brother, who was reportedly killed by the Bulgars", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210213005525/https://www.novelguide.com/candide/summaries/chapter-13-14"}
