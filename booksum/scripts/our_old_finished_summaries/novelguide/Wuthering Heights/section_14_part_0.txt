Chapter 32: Soon after Lockwood left the Grange, Ellen is called to the Heights as Zillah has left. She finds Catherine changed, and the happiness at having Ellen there soon leaves, and Catherine is irritable again as she is not allowed to leave the house.

One day when the others are out, she tells Hareton that she would like to be friends with him. He does not believe she means it, and she tries to tease him and make him agree to be friends. She finally convinces him by kissing him on the cheek and giving him a book. They are soon happy and looking over the book and are friends instead of enemies.
