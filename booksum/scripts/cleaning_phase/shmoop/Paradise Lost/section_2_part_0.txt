{"name": "Book 3", "summary": "Milton addresses the light emanating from Heaven, saying it is God's first \"offspring.\" This is the second invocation of the poem.<PARAGRAPH>The poet is now revisiting Heaven, after having spent the first two books in Hell.<PARAGRAPH>He still feels the heavenly light, but he can't see it because he's blind. This doesn't prevent him from writing poetry, however. He's too tough for that.<PARAGRAPH>The poet hasn't forgotten about other famous blind poets and prophets, such as Homer and Tiresias; he's \"equal\" to them in blindness and hopes to be \"equal\" to them in fame.<PARAGRAPH>The poet can't see anything so he asks the \"celestial light\" to shine inward - i.e., give him some kind of mental vision so he can compose poetry and talk about things that most humans can't see anyway .<PARAGRAPH>God is in Heaven, looking down at his angels, at Adam and Eve, and at Satan. His Son  sits on his right.<PARAGRAPH>God describes Satan's malice to His Son. God knows what he's  up to, and he knows that Satan will succeed in his attempts to tempt mankind.<PARAGRAPH>Everyone - man and angels included - has a choice. If they didn't have a choice, their obedience to God would be a joke; it wouldn't be meaningful.<PARAGRAPH>God stresses that predestination doesn't exist; both mankind, Satan, and the other rebel angels fell by their own choice: \"they themselves decreed/ Their own revolt, not I\" .<PARAGRAPH>Because mankind was deceived, he will find grace at some point. Satan and company will get nothing.<PARAGRAPH>God's Son responds. He praises God's resolution regarding man  because it simply isn't possible that Satan should win.<PARAGRAPH>God responds, telling his Son that he's read his mind exactly. Some men will be saved, but not because of their own will but because of God's grace.<PARAGRAPH>God says everyone will have the ability to hear his call; he'll implant a conscience in them, which will help them achieve grace, Heaven, or whatever safely.<PARAGRAPH>But wait, what about all of man's sins? They have no way of making up for those, unless someone will become mortal and die for their sins. Any volunteers?<PARAGRAPH>Heaven stands \"mute.\" Nobody wants to make the sacrifice. This could have been the end for mankind if the Son hadn't stood up.<PARAGRAPH>He'll do it; he'll become mortal and die for man's sins.<PARAGRAPH>The Son says he knows he'll be giving up a lot in Heaven, but he also knows that he won't really die .<PARAGRAPH>He'll rise from the dead, defeat Satan and death itself, and lead Hell captive. Then he'll return to Heaven.<PARAGRAPH>God responds to the Son, saying essentially \"thank God for you my Son, otherwise man would have been toast.\"<PARAGRAPH>The entire human race will be saved through the intercession of his Son, and through him only.<PARAGRAPH>The Son won't degrade himself by becoming a man, says God; so great a sacrifice will do nothing but exalt him.<PARAGRAPH>Moreover, He will then make his Son sole ruler of the universe. \"All knees to thee shall bow, of them that bide / In Heaven, or Earth, or under earth in Hell\" .<PARAGRAPH>God continues, saying that eventually there will be a Last Judgment  when the Son will send some people to Hell and some to Heaven.<PARAGRAPH>After that, Hell will be closed off completely, the earth will be burned, and a new Heaven and earth will emerge.<PARAGRAPH>All Heaven resounds with hymns of praise, cheering, and \"jubilee.\" The angels bow down before God's and the Son's thrones, before picking up their harps and making music.<PARAGRAPH>The narrator tells us that the Son is God's agent; it was through the Son that he created the universe and through him that he defeated the rebel angels.<PARAGRAPH>Meanwhile, Satan emerges from Chaos at the outer edge of the created universe.<PARAGRAPH>He's like a vulture in the Himalayas who can't find any food so he goes in search of more fertile pastures but then stops off in a barren region.<PARAGRAPH>From his position he can see Heaven's gate - it is made with diamonds, gold, and other jewels - and a set of stairs that go from the created universe up to Heaven.<PARAGRAPH>At the bottom of the stairs is a portal that opens into the universe; Satan looks through the portal, almost as if he had been hiking all night and finally got to the top of a hill from which he could see an entire land or city, glistening in the dawn's light.<PARAGRAPH>Satan doesn't stick around to enjoy the view but flies right through the portal. He lands on the sun! It's really bright - \"beyond expression bright\" - and colorful.<PARAGRAPH>Satan looks around the universe - it's always sunny, no shade yet. He sees an angel in the sun with his back turned and a tiara on his head. He looks busy, or at least as if he's thinking deeply.<PARAGRAPH>Satan quickly changes his appearance; he turns into a young Cherub  and approaches the angel, who turns around when he hears Satan approaching.<PARAGRAPH>It's Uriel, one of the seven angels who stand closest to God's throne. Satan addresses him, saying he wants to check out God's new creation. He asks him which planet is man's.<PARAGRAPH>Uriel - who can't tell he's being duped - responds to Satan, saying there's nothing wrong with wanting to see God's creations.<PARAGRAPH>Uriel himself saw the world created; he points out the location of Paradise  for Satan, who thanks him and heads towards the earth, landing on Mt. Niphates.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210506193955/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/paradise-lost/summary/book-3"}
