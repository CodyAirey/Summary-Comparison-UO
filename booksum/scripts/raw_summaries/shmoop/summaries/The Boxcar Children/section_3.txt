{"name": "Chapter 4", "summary": "The kids wait quietly in the boxcar, hoping to discover the source of the noise. Benny thinks it might be a bear; things are sort of tense.<PARAGRAPH>Oh, good, it's not a bear\u2014it's just a dog with an injured paw.<PARAGRAPH>The dog hops over to Jessie, who removes a thorn from his foot and ties a wet handkerchief around it as a bandage.<PARAGRAPH>Jessie holds the dog so he can rest while the other children go to pick blueberries.<PARAGRAPH>After a while, Jessie goes over to help, still holding the dog.<PARAGRAPH>Oh, here's Henry\u2014he brought milk and cheese and bread.<PARAGRAPH>Henry is psyched about the dog. He thinks the pup will make a great watchdog.<PARAGRAPH>Benny informs the group that the dog's name is Watch. Guess that's settled.<PARAGRAPH>It's time for dinner, so Jessie arranges the laundry bag into a tablecloth and cuts the bread and cheese into chunks. She also puts out the blueberries. Henry is psyched about those, too.<PARAGRAPH>Everyone (including Watch) eats dinner. There's some milk leftover at the end, which they'll have for breakfast.<PARAGRAPH>Jessie declares that they will sleep on beds\u2014though by beds, she actually means pine needles.<PARAGRAPH>As they arrange their \"beds\" in the boxcar, Jessie plots out the space. She thinks there will be room for a kitchen and a sitting room. Jessie has a pretty active imagination.<PARAGRAPH>Time to wash up. Afterward, Jessie washes the towels and hangs them on a clothesline to dry.<PARAGRAPH>Jessie thinks they should have a little nightcap before bed, by which she means some water.<PARAGRAPH>Henry takes two empty milk bottles off to the water fountain, and after a few sips, everyone is ready for bed. It's hot, so they leave the door of the boxcar open.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219155156/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/boxcar-children/summary/chapter-4"}
