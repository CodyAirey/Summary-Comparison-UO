{"name": "Chapter 19", "summary": "Actually, Griffin threw some stuff around because he's just kind of an angry guy, as Kemp notes.<PARAGRAPH>Kemp tells Griffin that he wants to help, but first, he needs to know his story. So strap yourself in for Griffin's story. <PARAGRAPH>Griffin was a medical student at the same time as Kemp, but Griffin switched to physics because he was interested in light. He came up with a loose theory for how to make objects invisible, but needed to figure out a method to actually do it.<PARAGRAPH>. If it's not plain sailing for you, you can always read up a little more on the concepts.)<PARAGRAPH>Griffin left London  six years ago and went to Chesilstowe, where he was a teacher and a student. What he really wanted to do, though, was continue his research into invisibility.<PARAGRAPH>Still - and this is his big problem - his professor  was \"a scientific bounder, a journalist by instinct, a thief of ideas--he was always prying!\" . Griffin didn't want to publish his research because then Oliver would get a lot of credit for it.<PARAGRAPH>Griffin had done all this work himself. As he notes, \"In all my great moments I have been alone\" .<PARAGRAPH>One night, alone, Griffin figured out how to make a human invisible. Pretty soon he was thinking about making himself invisible, since it would get him out of his life as \"a shabby, poverty-struck, hemmed-in demonstrator, teaching fools in a provincial college\" . Harsh!<PARAGRAPH>After three years of teaching and research, he didn't have the money he needed to complete his research. So he did the obvious thing: he robbed his dad.<PARAGRAPH>Unfortunately, the money he stole was not actually his dad's, and so his dad shot himself.<PARAGRAPH>", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210623094503/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/invisible-man-wells/summary/chapter-19"}
