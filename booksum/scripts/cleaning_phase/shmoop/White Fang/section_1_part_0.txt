{"name": "Part 2", "summary": "New section, new perspective. From the guy who was almost food, we shift to the pack that almost ate him.<PARAGRAPH>The pack has three leaders--a big grey wolf, a three-year-old wolf, and an old, skunky one-eyed wolf. They all compete for the affections of the she-wolf.<PARAGRAPH>Times are bad, but the pack runs on until they find a bull moose to eat.<PARAGRAPH>The pack then breaks up into mating pairs, with the three co-leaders traveling with the she-wolf. The three-year-old tears up One Eye's ear <PARAGRAPH>And... fight.<PARAGRAPH>One Eye and the big grey make mincemeat of the three-year-old. Then the grey makes the mistake of lowering his guard against One Eye. Competition = over.<PARAGRAPH>One Eye and the she-wolf travel on until they run into a Native American camp. They then have a blast raiding the camp's rabbit snares for food.<PARAGRAPH>Nature takes its course and the she-wolf soon finds herself in a family way.<PARAGRAPH>She finds a cave on the bank of a river to hole up and have her cubs.<PARAGRAPH>Like any good father, One Eye heads out to get food for his family. He finds a porcupine who immediately balls up. Being the clever old wolf that he is, he moves on.<PARAGRAPH>He then finds a ptarmigan--a kind of bird--who's a little slow on the draw. Food = secured.<PARAGRAPH>On the way back, he watches a showdown between the porcupine and a lynx. The lynx waits out the porcupine and wounds it, but earns a snootful of spines in the bargain. She runs off, leaving One Eye with tasty, tasty porcupine carcass.<PARAGRAPH>He can't carry both bodies, so he eats the bird and drags the porcupine back to the wife and kids.<PARAGRAPH>The she-wolf has five puppies in the litter. All have her reddish hue expect for one, who is quite grey.<PARAGRAPH>The grey cub is fascinated with the \"wall of light\" representing the mouth of the cave. He tries to reach it a couple of times, only to get snapped back by Mom .<PARAGRAPH>The lean times come and the family gets hungry. Four of the cubs die, leaving only the grey one still alive.<PARAGRAPH>One Eye vanishes too, taken down by the lynx. So, like every other single parent, Mom's gotta get up and head to work.<PARAGRAPH>She stays away from the lynx, who has kittens of her own. Unfortunately, she doesn't have much choice, since her last cub still needs vittles and there's none a'comin'.<PARAGRAPH>The cub grows more adventuresome when his mother is gone. He instinctively senses a wolverine prowling out front.  His mother sends the wolverine packing, but the instinctive sensing of it remains.<PARAGRAPH>Still, curiosity eventually wins out, and he ventures out of the cave and into the world.<PARAGRAPH>He discovers all kinds of cool things -squirrels and woodpeckers and whatnot--before stumbling into a nest of ptarmigans. He kills a chick and then the mother before a hawk scares him off. It's all as cute as can be... except for the death and killing and stuff.<PARAGRAPH>The cub retreats to his cave, pondering the truths of life: living things are fun to eat, but bigger living things can eat you.<PARAGRAPH>He eventually leaves again, then slips and falls into a stream. He pulls himself out, then tries to head back to Mom.<PARAGRAPH>He runs into a weasel, who almost kills him. He's saved only by the timely arrival of Super Mom. She kills the weasel and eats it with her son. Ah, mother-son bonding.<PARAGRAPH>The cub goes out again and finds the weasel's child. Then he eats it. He gets stronger and bolder.<PARAGRAPH>His bloodlust grows, as does his admiration for his mother, who can kill like nobody's business.<PARAGRAPH>Another famine comes, and he no longer hunts just because all the cool kids are doing it. He hunts in earnest.<PARAGRAPH>The famine breaks and Mom comes back with food: a baby lynx.<PARAGRAPH>Soon enough Cranky Mommy Lynx shows up and the battle of the moms is on.<PARAGRAPH>The she-wolf kills the lynx, but is badly hurt in the process. She spends a week lying next to the lynx's body, only venturing out the drink water.<PARAGRAPH>They slowly eat the lynx and the she-wolf finally heals. After that, she hunts with the pup.<PARAGRAPH>The pup's lesson for this chapter is so important, London writes it in all-caps: EAT OR BE EATEN.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219192558/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/white-fang/summary/part-2"}
