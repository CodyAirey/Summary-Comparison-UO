{"name": "Chapter 22", "summary": "This chapter starts with a famous quote from Act II of Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice . In this passage Shylock, the Jew, cries out because his daughter Jessica has eloped with a Christian and stolen his money. These lines are from a Jewish character who has lost both his daughter and his cash - which implies that Isaac and Rebecca are going to feature in this chapter.<PARAGRAPH>We switch focus to Isaac of York, who has been stuck in the castle dungeons.<PARAGRAPH>Reginald Front-de-Boeuf and Bois-Guilbert's two Muslim servants enter Isaac's cell.<PARAGRAPH>Front-de-Boeuf demands a thousand pounds of silver from Isaac.<PARAGRAPH>Isaac has no hope of coming up with that much money; all the Jews of the city of York put together don't have that much.<PARAGRAPH>Front-de-Boeuf is willing to accept gold instead of silver if necessary.<PARAGRAPH>Front-de-Boeuf threatens Isaac with horrible torture if he doesn't pay up. He promises that he's capable of torture, which he's done plenty of during the Crusades in the Holy Land.<PARAGRAPH>Under the threat of torture, Isaac agrees to pay the thousand pounds of silver.<PARAGRAPH>Front-de-Boeuf won't let Isaac go free until the silver is paid.<PARAGRAPH>Isaac asks if he can ransom his fellow prisoners with that same thousand pounds.<PARAGRAPH>Front-de-Boeuf tells Isaac not to worry about the Saxons; they are here for different reasons.<PARAGRAPH>Isaac asks if his daughter, Rebecca, can go to York to gather the treasure.<PARAGRAPH>Front-de-Boeuf sneers that he's already sent Rebecca to Bois-Guilbert.<PARAGRAPH>Isaac is heartbroken. He refuses to pay a penny to Front-de-Boeuf, no matter what tortures he has to suffer. Isaac won't help the man who took his daughter away.<PARAGRAPH>Front-de-Boeuf starts preparing to torture Isaac, but he is interrupted by the horn blasts from the castle gate.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210614173333/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/ivanhoe/summary/chapter-22"}
