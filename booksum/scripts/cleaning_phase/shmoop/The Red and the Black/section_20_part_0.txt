It's clear that the letter has told him about his wife's affair.<PARAGRAPH>The whole thing makes de Renal think about how many men dislike him and how few like him. He even thinks about friends whom he cut ties with when he was younger because they weren't upper class enough.<PARAGRAPH>He thinks about beating up Julien and throwing him out of the house.
