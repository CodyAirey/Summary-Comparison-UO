Now that we've established that, we can let Beauty get on with his story.<PARAGRAPH>Squire and Mistress Gordon ask James to drive them to visit some friends who live forty-six miles away. It's a long trip, and they stop at a hotel along the way, where two ostlers come to care for Beauty and Ginger.<PARAGRAPH>One of the ostlers really knows how to, er, ostle\u2026 we think: \"I never was cleaned so lightly and quickly as by that little old man\" (15.3), Beauty says.

He thinks Beauty and Ginger are fabulous (15.5).<PARAGRAPH>We find out, through James's conversation with the ostler, that Squire Gordon is the \"best rider in the county\" (15.9), though he hardly rides anymore since his son was killed riding Rob Roy.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201205154804/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/black-beauty/summary/chapter-15"}
