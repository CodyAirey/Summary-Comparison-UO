It stands for Philosophical Intelligence Office, which is a counterintuitive name for an agency that places servants in jobs. This man in a shabby suit is trying to get Pitch to hire one of his boys. Pitch is not into it: he's hired 30 boys from various backgrounds, and they've all been scoundrels of all kinds. PIO is horrified that Pitch has such a dismal view of human nature and makes an argument that boys are lily buds with baby teeth who will grow into big plants with perma teeth that can bite through steel . He says he knows this scientifically, as a studier of human nature. Pitch is doubtful. Pitch is so doubtful that PIO brings out the big guns. He plays the St. Augustine card. Pitch hearts St. Augustine and begins to soften his stance. PIO then low-blows an insult to Pitch's animal-skin outfit as an outward example of his disordered mind--and that seems to be enough to break him. Pitch agrees to try out one of PIO's boys for a job instead of getting a machine like a cedar mill to do the work. Pitch asks about the price, and PIO says his is pricier than other agencies, and he needs to be paid upfront. Pitch gives PIO the money and extra for the boy's transportation. PIO: Oh, yes, I forgot about that. Very good, thanks. Before the transaction is over, though, PIO stops Pitch and says that he'll accept Pitch's money if and only if he declares that he Pitch has 100% confidence in him. Pitch: Oh. Heck, yes. Just then, the boat pulls up against a bluff that PIO says is called the Devil's Joke. Ha ha.", "analysis": ""}
