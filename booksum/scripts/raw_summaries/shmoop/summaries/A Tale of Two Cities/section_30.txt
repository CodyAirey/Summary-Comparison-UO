We know that. But now it\u2019s extra slow. Even slower than before.  Sloooooooow.<PARAGRAPH>Darnay, of course, happens to be traveling in 1792.<PARAGRAPH>He\u2019s not getting too far.<PARAGRAPH>Everywhere he goes, he\u2019s stopped. People have to check his papers. Then they have to re-check them.<PARAGRAPH>Meanwhile, Darnay waits for several hours.<PARAGRAPH>This happens over and over. And over.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, in the middle of the night, he\u2019s taken prisoner by a group of patriots.<PARAGRAPH>They deliver him to the local authorities, who decide that he\u2019s an emigrant and must be sent to Paris immediately.<PARAGRAPH>When Darnay tries to protest, he gets smacked around for a while. Apparently, folks have figured out that he\u2019s an aristocrat.<PARAGRAPH>Needless to say, they\u2019re not too happy about the news.<PARAGRAPH>Bundled into a carriage, Darnay begins the halting, slow journey to the capital.<PARAGRAPH>The patriots force him to pay for an armed escort into the capital. After all, anything could happen to him on the road.<PARAGRAPH>On the way, a man screams out that a decree has been passed: the property of all emigrants can be confiscated by the Republic.<PARAGRAPH>Darnay begins to realize that his trip might just be a bit more complicated than he\u2019d planned.<PARAGRAPH>The crowds aren\u2019t all that pleased to see him pass.<PARAGRAPH>Some even threaten to kill the aristocrat. Others mutter that he\u2019ll be judged when he gets to Paris.<PARAGRAPH>Friendly country, huh?<PARAGRAPH>At the gates of the city, a guardsman asks for the papers of the prisoner.<PARAGRAPH>Darnay isn\u2019t too excited about the fact that he\u2019s gone from being a traveler to an emigrant to a prisoner.<PARAGRAPH>Sure enough, he\u2019s taken to the prison.<PARAGRAPH>Defarge is there. He identifies Darnay as \"Citizen Evr\u00e9monde.\"<PARAGRAPH>The officer holding Darnay\u2019s papers looks at him, nods, and condemns him to prison.<PARAGRAPH>Aghast, Darnay wants to know why.<PARAGRAPH>He\u2019s done nothing wrong\u2014nothing against the law.<PARAGRAPH>The man smiles grimly. He informs Darnay that there are new laws now.<PARAGRAPH>In fact, under these laws, emigrants have no rights at all.<PARAGRAPH>As they walk away, Defarge quietly asks Darnay if he\u2019s Dr. Manette\u2019s son-in-law.<PARAGRAPH>Darnay says he is.<PARAGRAPH>Desperate, Darnay turns to Defarge and begs for help.<PARAGRAPH>Defarge refuses. It\u2019s not in his power.<PARAGRAPH>Darnay asks if he\u2019ll be imprisoned without trial or any attention to justice.<PARAGRAPH>Sniffing a bit, Defarge says that many people have been unfairly imprisoned before.<PARAGRAPH>Darnay responds, \"But not by me.\"<PARAGRAPH>Defarge looks darkly at him for a minute, then walks in silence.<PARAGRAPH>Darnay asks for one favor: that Defarge will tell Mr. Lorry that Darnay has been imprisoned in La Force.<PARAGRAPH>Refusing, Defarge declares that he\u2019s a patriot. He can do nothing to help aristocrats.<PARAGRAPH>With that, Defarge turns Darnay over to the gaoler of La Force.<PARAGRAPH>The prison isn\u2019t that great a place to be. It\u2019s smelly and dark and all-around disgusting.<PARAGRAPH>Within the prison, Darnay is greeted by faded aristocrats who crowd against him in the small rooms.<PARAGRAPH>They\u2019re almost ghostly; their courtly manners are\u2026just a bit creepy in this dismal location.<PARAGRAPH>Darnay ends up in a small tower. He begs the gaoler to sell him a pen and paper.<PARAGRAPH>The gaoler refuses. At present, the only thing Darnay can buy is food.<PARAGRAPH>Left alone in his cell, Darnay begins to pace frantically.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210115212823/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/tale-of-two-cities/summary/volume-3-chapter-1"}
