{"name": "Act 2, Scene 3", "summary": "Now that Shakespeare's given us a murder and a lot of spooky crazy talk from Macbeth, we're obviously ready for a brief, comedic interlude.<PARAGRAPH>There's a ton of knocking and the Porter  does a lot of joking around about what it would be like to be a porter of \"hellgate.\"<PARAGRAPH>Apparently, a porter in hell would be a busy guy since there are so many evil and corrupt people in the world.The Porter runs through a bunch of scenarios for who could be at the door  and he has witty remarks for all of them. Things like: \"I hope you brought a handkerchief--you're going to get sweaty!\" and \"You can heat up your iron in here!\" <PARAGRAPH>It's Macduff and Lennox, who have come to fetch the king.<PARAGRAPH>The laugh-a-minute Porter makes a bunch of jokes about how drinking an excessive amount of alcohol, like he's been doing, makes a man frisky --but it also detracts from his \"performance\" in the sack, not to mention turning his nose red and making him have to pee.<PARAGRAPH>Enter Macbeth, the picture of sleepy innocence while he makes small talk with Lennox and sends Macduff to wake Duncan.<PARAGRAPH>Lennox notes that some spooky things have been happening all night --he heard a bunch of screams, there was a little earthquake, and the fire in his chimney blew out.<PARAGRAPH>Yep, says Macbeth, it was a pretty rough night. But not as rough as it was for Duncan, who Macduff has just found murdered.<PARAGRAPH>Macduff tells Macbeth and Lennox to go see Duncan's body for themselves. It's too gruesome for him to describe, except to say that viewing the scene is like looking at a Gorgon.  Macduff sounds the alarm to wake the whole castle, both by yelling his head off and calling for a bell to be rung.<PARAGRAPH>Everyone starts running around, Lady Macbeth and Banquo show up, and then Macbeth starts a way-too-eager eulogy about the King's great virtues.<PARAGRAPH>So, who murdered the king? Lennox thinks that the drunken guards covered in the King's blood and holding their daggers are a good bet.<PARAGRAPH>Macbeth casually announces that he killed both of the guards in a fit of pious rage, out of his love for the King.<PARAGRAPH>Apparently, no one thinks it's weird that the guards went to sleep with the bloody daggers in hand.<PARAGRAPH>Lady Macbeth, upon hearing that Macbeth has done this, wisely stages a diversion--or maybe she really does nearly faint in response to her husband's stupidity. In either case, she needs to be escorted out. .<PARAGRAPH>Donalbain and Malcolm privately decide that they probably shouldn't stay in the house where their dad was killed. Good thinking. A+ for self-preservation. The rest of the men say they suspect treason and agree to meet in the hall to discuss the situation, pronto.<PARAGRAPH>Malcolm will go to England and Donalbain to Ireland, making it more difficult to murder them both.<PARAGRAPH>The dead king's sons slip out, unnoticed, while everyone else gets dressed and prepares to talk this thing through.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210605115042/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/macbeth/summary/act-2-scene-3"}
