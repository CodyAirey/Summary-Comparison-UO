{"name": "Chapter 20", "summary": "Like \"Ettrick Forest\" in Chapter 18, this chapter's epigraph is one of Scott's own poems: \"The Hermit of St. Clement's Well.\" The poem describes a hermit singing hymns  of devotion. This is clearly a joke, since the only song we see the Friar singing in this chapter is a drinking song.<PARAGRAPH>After three hours' walking, Wamba, Gurth, and Locksley arrive at an armed camp deep in the forest.<PARAGRAPH>These are outlaws under Locksley's command.<PARAGRAPH>Locksley tells his men: a band of guys disguised in our clothing  are taking prisoners past the chapel at Copmanhurst.<PARAGRAPH>Locksley, Wamba, and Gurth head off to see the Friar.<PARAGRAPH>As they approach the chapel, they hear the sound of drunken singing: it's the Black Knight and the Friar.<PARAGRAPH>Gurth confirms that the Friar is well-known for being drunk and disorderly; he's also a poacher.<PARAGRAPH>At the knock at the door, the Friar quickly hides the wine that he and the Black Knight have been drinking.<PARAGRAPH>The Friar tries to make his visitors go away by pretending that he and the Black Knight are in the middle of a prayer.<PARAGRAPH>Locksley demands that the Friar let them in.<PARAGRAPH>As soon as the Friar sees it's Locksley, he relaxes.<PARAGRAPH>Locksley reminds the Friar that it's completely forbidden among their group of outlaws to welcome strange knights.<PARAGRAPH>The Friar claims that he and the Black Knight are old friends .<PARAGRAPH>The Friar quickly changes into the same green clothing that Locksley and his band wear.<PARAGRAPH>Locksley pulls the Black Knight aside to ask if he's the same guy who helped defeat the Normans at the tournament.<PARAGRAPH>The Black Knight confirms that he is.<PARAGRAPH>As a fellow lover of England, Locksley wants the Black Knight to help them rescue Rowena and Cedric from the Normans.<PARAGRAPH>The Black Knight happily agrees.<PARAGRAPH>The Friar is now completely dressed and armed as an outlaw. He drinks some water and washes his face to sober up.<PARAGRAPH>They're now ready to raid Reginald Front-de-Boeuf's castle, Torquilstone.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210614173333/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/ivanhoe/summary/chapter-20"}
