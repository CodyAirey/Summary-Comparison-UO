As soon as the monster comes to life, however, Victor is filled with intense revulsion. He explains, \"the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart.\" He immediately leaves his apartment, feeling a mental breakdown coming on. Outside he bumps into Henry Clerval, his dear childhood friend who has come to Ingolstadt to visit Frankenstein and study oriental languages. Victor is very agitated still, but keeps himself from telling Henry what the matter is; the presence of Clerval helps him to relax. Clerval relates that everyone is fine at home, though worried that Victor hasn't written lately. Finally the two return to his apartment, and Frankenstein anxiously peaks into his room, relieved to discover that the beast has disappeared. Chapter 6: Clerval gives Victor a letter from Elizabeth. She is sincerely worried about him and desperately tries to persuade him to give some news of what he's doing. Elizabeth also says that the other children are doing well; Ernest, who wants to join the military, and little William, are growing up rapidly; also, the family has adopted a girl named Justine Moritz who has come from a troubled family. After reading the letter, Victor quickly writes back to Elizabeth, though this exercise fatigues him immensely. The next day, Victor introduces Clerval to his science professors, Krempe and Waldman. Over the next several months, Clerval and Frankenstein remain in England, but prepare to return to Geneva in the fall. Clerval helps Victor re-enter social life in many ways, and for the first time in many months, Frankenstein feels relatively happy. In the back of his mind, however, lingers the idea of the horrible monster he has created.", "analysis": ""}
