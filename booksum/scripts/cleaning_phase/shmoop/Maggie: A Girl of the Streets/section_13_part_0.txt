{"name": "Chapter 14", "summary": "What would she do without Pete? Maggie has been out of the house for three weeks and Pete is her everything, which is never a good thing, ladies. They continue to hang out at a sequence of seedy bars and cheesy entertainment venues.<PARAGRAPH>Pete no longer gazes at Maggie the same way, though, and now she stares at him \"spaniel-like\" just hoping for a sign...<PARAGRAPH>Enter Nellie: \"A woman of brilliance and audacity\" . Whatever attention Pete was paying to Maggie immediately evaporates; this old flame is suddenly all Pete cares about.<PARAGRAPH>A really cringe-worthy exchange ensues in which Pete pants over Nellie, Nellie puts on airs, Nellie's boy escort--a.k.a. Freddie--sulks, and Maggie fumes. The two spurned lovers look on while Nellie and Pete \"reminisce of days together\" .<PARAGRAPH>The more Nellie humiliates and dismisses Pete, the more he follows her around. Pretty soon the two of them leave together, and Maggie is left sitting with Freddie . He takes it upon himself to clarify this situation for the rosy-tinted Maggie: Nellie and Pete aren't coming back.<PARAGRAPH>Maggie announces she is going home, a concept that Mike/Freddie does not seem to grasp--like, home? What's that?<PARAGRAPH>She gets up and leaves.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20211026073909/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/maggie-a-girl-of-the-streets/summary/chapter-14"}
