Isabel is amused, although her underlying melancholy reminds her that Henrietta\u2019s marriage represents a kind of breakdown in their shared belief in female independence. Still, the marriage is a pretty funny idea.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Bantling joins them, and Isabel congratulates him.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210508161644/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/portrait-of-a-lady/summary/chapter-53"}
