{"name": "Book 8, Chapter 1", "summary": "Strether keeps rambling along and killing time. During this period, he keeps up a fairly chilly relationship with Waymarsh, which seems to suit Waymarsh just fine. He gives Waymarsh several opportunities to confess to writing to the Newsomes, but the dude never admits to anything.<PARAGRAPH>For Strether, this period also gives him the most independence he's felt since arriving in Paris, since he's pretty much free of Waymarsh.<PARAGRAPH>On a random walk one day, Strether stops in at Madame de Vionnet's house and asks if the lady is at home. The doorman replies that Madame is out of the city, and Strether walks away disappointed.<PARAGRAPH>At this moment, he's struck with a sudden fear of Sarah Pocock and dreads her arrival in Paris. He knows that he's easily influenced, and he's scared that Sarah will suck away all his newfound enjoyment of life. After all, if he could get turned on to the European life so easily, it makes sense that he could just as easily be turned off of it.<PARAGRAPH>And all in a flash, he finds himself standing on the platform at the train station. He welcomes Sarah, her husband Jim, and Mamie Pocock as they arrive. Waymarsh has accompanied him.<PARAGRAPH>At this moment, Strether realizes that Sarah and Waymarsh will probably get along very well, since they're both total sticks-in-the-mud .<PARAGRAPH>Strether makes a few comments to Chad about his mother sending her daughter like a piece in a chess game. But then he feels ashamed because lately, it must sound like he's constantly taking jabs at Chad's mom.<PARAGRAPH>Chad doesn't think this is the case though, which makes Strether feel better.<PARAGRAPH>Strether explains to Chad that the reason the Pococks have come is because he has spoken very highly of Paris and Madame de Vionnet when he obviously wasn't supposed to.<PARAGRAPH>The two of them ponder a bit about whether de Vionnet will be able to make Sarah Pocock like her. They both decide that it's impossible to tell until the women actually meet. Good conclusion.<PARAGRAPH>They finish the chapter by wondering to each other whether Mrs. Newsome has even mentioned Madame de Vionnet to Sarah. One can never know when it comes to Mrs. Newsome's strategy. She always seems to be a few steps ahead. .", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219182819/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/the-ambassadors/summary/book-8-chapter-1"}
