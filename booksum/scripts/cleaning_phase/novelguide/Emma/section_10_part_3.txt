{"name": "volume 2, Chapter 33", "summary": "Chapter 33: At later meetings, Emma is even more convinced that Mrs. Elton is self-important, presuming, familiar, ignorant and ill-bred, but Mr. Elton goes around congratulating himself on bringing such a woman to Highbury. Emma soon realizes that Mrs. Elton has drawn away from her and become cold and distant, probably since Emma did not encourage their friendship. She also sees that both Mr. and Mrs. Elton are sneering and negligent to Harriet. Mrs. Elton does take very much to Jane Fairfax though. She takes it on as her duty to find a good situation for Jane since she is destined to be a governess. She says she will introduce her wherever she can. Emma feels sorry for Jane, and is quite surprised when Jane accepts her attentions. When she speaks of her surprise to Mrs. Weston, Mrs. Weston supposes that Jane just wants to get away from her aunt for a while. Mr. Knightley agrees, saying that if another had paid her attention, meaning Emma, she might not have had to go to Mrs. Elton. Mr. Knightley speaks highly of Jane, and Emma suggests that he might think more highly of her than he can admit. He catches her hint, and says that he does not think that Jane would accept him if he asked her to marry him, and that he would never ask her anyway, as he does not think of her like that", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210421073237/http://www.novelguide.com/emma/summaries/chap31-33"}
