{"name": "Chapter XXIII", "summary": "Chapter XXIII. De Bracy visits Rowena in her imprisonment, aiming to win her hand in marriage. He tries to charm her, but she responds only with contempt. He then takes a tougher approach, telling her that if she does not leave the castle as his wife, she will never leave it at all. He also reveals that he knows of Rowena's love for Wilfred of Ivanhoe, and tells her that Ivanhoe will never marry her because he too is a prisoner in the castle. De Bracy also reveals that Front-de-Boeuf wants the land that is Ivanhoe's by right. De Bracy says Front-de-Boeuf will not harm Ivanhoe if Rowena agrees to marry him, De Bracy. Otherwise, Ivanhoe will die. Cedric's fate also rests on her decision. Rowena weeps in despair, and De Bracy has no idea of how to respond to her", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210304062321/https://www.novelguide.com/ivanhoe/summaries/chapter22-24"}
