{"name": "Chapter 11", "summary": "Days go by. The children keep finding garbage treasures; Henry continues to work for Dr. Moore.<PARAGRAPH>Very exciting news: Henry buys Benny some new socks. The girls make Benny a stuffed bear from his old socks.<PARAGRAPH>Benny wants his bear to have a long tail even though bears don't have long tails. Whatever, Benny--you do you.<PARAGRAPH>The bear is finished, and Benny names it Stockings because that's the old-fashioned word for socks.<PARAGRAPH>Jessie gives Benny a haircut, so Benny decides to cut Watch the dog's hair. This does not go well.<PARAGRAPH>When he shows Jessie and Violet Watch's haircut, they laugh and laugh. Watch is a really good sport about it.<PARAGRAPH>Violet is laughing so hard she cries--but then she keeps crying and won't stop. Turns out she's not hysterical; she's sick.<PARAGRAPH>Jessie puts Violet to bed in the boxcar. Her forehead is really hot.<PARAGRAPH>Henry comes home, and he and Jessie discuss taking Violet to the hospital. Trouble is, they're worried it will put their grandfather on their trail.<PARAGRAPH>Violet is shaking all over, so Jessie covers her with pine needles. Let's give her points for trying.<PARAGRAPH>Henry decides that Violet should see Dr. Moore, so he runs into town. Dr. Moore drives back to the boxcar without asking where to go, and when he parks the car, he finds the boxcar straightaway. Odd, isn't it?<PARAGRAPH>Dr. Moore decides to take Violet back to his place. Once there, he puts her to bed, and Mrs. Moore and the cook tend to her.<PARAGRAPH>Don't worry--the other children are going to stay at Dr. Moore's, too. Violet is so ill that Dr. Moore stays up with her all night.<PARAGRAPH>In the morning, a man comes to see Dr. Moore.

Benny also tells the man that his sister Violet is ill.<PARAGRAPH>Benny and Mr. Alden are getting along really well. Benny asks Mr. Alden if he has a dog, but Mr. Alden's dog is dead. Bummer.<PARAGRAPH>Oh, here's Watch the dog, very much alive. Hi, Watch.<PARAGRAPH>Dr. Moore comes in and sends Benny off to play. The doctor tells Mr. Alden that Benny is his grandchild, and Mr. Alden seems excited but confused.<PARAGRAPH>Now, Dr. Moore tells Mr. Alden about Henry.
