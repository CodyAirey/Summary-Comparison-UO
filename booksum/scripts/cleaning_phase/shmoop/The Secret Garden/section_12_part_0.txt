How dare the weather turn bad when she finally has something to look forward to?<PARAGRAPH>But obviously, if you're living in a house with over a hundred rooms, there is probably something to look at.<PARAGRAPH>She hears that quiet crying sound again, and she decides to go find it, even though it's late at night.<PARAGRAPH>She turns down a number of passages and finds a big room with a low fire and expensive furniture.<PARAGRAPH>There is a boy lying in bed, looking tired and annoyed. His name is Colin.<PARAGRAPH>There's a lot of confusion between Colin and Mary: Are they both sure that the other isn't a ghost? How is it possible that they can both be real? Two unknown, lonely children in the same house? What's going on here?<PARAGRAPH>It turns out that Colin is Mr. Craven's son.<PARAGRAPH>Colin was born when Mrs. Craven died, and Mr. Craven can't stand to look at him because he reminds Mr. Craven too much of his beloved dead wife.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Craven is also worried that Colin is doomed to be \"a hunchback\"  since Mr. Craven's shoulders are crooked, and that Colin is too sickly to live to adulthood.<PARAGRAPH>So Colin spends most  of his time inside his giant mansion being fussed over.<PARAGRAPH>All of the servants have to do exactly what he tells them, or he'll throw the most over-the-top tantrums. <PARAGRAPH>But he doesn't really enjoy any of his hissy fits--in fact, he doesn't enjoy anything.<PARAGRAPH>Colin admits that some great doctor said he would be fine if he got out more in the fresh air and was less spoiled.<PARAGRAPH>But Colin hates going outside, so that's the end of that.<PARAGRAPH>Mary tells Colin about the Secret Garden  and Colin seems interested at last.
