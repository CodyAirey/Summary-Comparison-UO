{"name": "Part 2 Chapter 10", "summary": "Part 2 Chapter 10<PARAGRAPH>Part 2 Chapter 10: The UM realizes that his idea of love is simply \"tyrannizing and demonstrating [his] moral superiority.\" For this reason he tries to give her a five-ruble note; but she doesn't accept it, making him even more miserable.  For the UM realizes that his love has been tainted by his books, by his head.  Liza, on the other hand, shows him true love, love from the heart-selfless love.\n\tThus, the UM concludes that he has ruined his life \"through moral decay in [his] corner.\" Not living up to his own self-framed image of himself as a hero, he is, indeed, the epitome of an anti-hero.  Lastly, he returns to his idea that suffering and anguish can be man's most advantageous advantage.  He finds a certain satisfaction and truthfulness in his own suffering, and hopes that Liza will find a similar satisfaction, despite the obvious hardship and grief that the said suffering will entail.\n\tHere, the Notesjust cut off, with the editors explaining that \"we might as well stop here.\"", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200923070519/https://www.novelguide.com/notes-from-the-underground/summaries/part2-chap10"}
