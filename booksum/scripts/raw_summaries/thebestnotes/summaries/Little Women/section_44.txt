{"name": "chapter 46", "summary": "For two weeks Jo and Professor Bhaer meet each other daily when Jo goes \n        for her evening walk to Meg\u2019s house. Jo is afraid of being laughed at \n        and tries to keep her feelings hidden, but everyone is aware of change \n        in her.<PARAGRAPH>Suddenly, with no goodbyes or explanations, the professor stays away \n        for three days. One afternoon Jo takes her walk into town, saying she \n        needs more writing paper and offering to do some shopping for Mrs. March. \n        She soon wanders to a section of town that has nothing to do with her \n        shopping, but she does not find Mr. Bhaer. It begins to rain, so she rushes \n        toward home only to run into another pedestrian who happens to be Mr. \n        Bhaer.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Bhaer holds an umbrella for her and the two exchange a variety of \n        comments that alternately build and squelch their individual hopes regarding \n        each other\u2019s love. At length, Bhaer tells her that he has concluded his \n        business and will be taking a professorship in a school in the west. At \n        first he thinks she doesn\u2019t care, but on the walk home, he sees tears \n        in her eyes and asks the reason. She tells him it is because he is going \n        away. The professor\u2019s reaction is ecstatic; he offers his love even though \n        he has no money to go with it. Before they enter the house, he proposes \n        to her in the rain under the umbrella.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025235/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Little_Women_Alcott/Little_Women_Study_Guide19.html"}
