{"name": "chapter thirteen: a fellow of no delicacy", "summary": "Carton is a frequent visitor at the Manette residence; during his visits, however, he is usually gloomy and pretends that he \ncares for nothing in life. In truth, he is obsessed with Lucie. He wanders to her house on countless nights when his \ndrinking has brought no relief to his melancholy. Carton just wants to be near the girl of his dreams.<PARAGRAPH>One day when he goes to Soho to visit the Manettes, Carton finds Lucie alone at her work. He takes the opportunity to \nbare his heart to Lucie, professing his deep love for her. He states that he does not expect her to reciprocate his love, for \nhe feels unworthy of her beauty and goodness. He admits that he is a wasted drunk who will only sink further. He is \nglad, however, that Lucie has rekindled a flame in him, for its warmth is enough to keep him going. He does not have to \nlive with her to love her. In fact, he ironically promises that should the need arrive, he will gladly give his life to replace \nthat of someone she loves.<PARAGRAPH>The kind-hearted Lucie is touched by Carton\u0092s confession and tries to be reassuring. \n        She states that Carton can be saved and brought on the right track; however, \n        Carton feels that there is nothing to be done with his life and that his \n        grim fate is sealed.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Dickens/A_Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Study_Guide16.html"}
