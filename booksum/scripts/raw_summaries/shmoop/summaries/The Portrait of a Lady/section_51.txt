She longs to escape from the convent.<PARAGRAPH>In a moment of passion, Isabel asks Pansy to come away to England with her, but Pansy can\u2019t go against her father\u2019s wishes, even if she wants to.<PARAGRAPH>Pansy says that she had done a lot of thinking, and that she is more willing than ever to obey her father. Isabel can tell that she has given up on Edward Rosier.<PARAGRAPH>Pansy, again showing insight we didn\u2019t know she had, says that she does not like Madame Merle. Isabel tells her that she must never repeat that thought.<PARAGRAPH>Isabel promises to return and visit Pansy.<PARAGRAPH>Madame Merle waits for Isabel, and springs upon her as she leaves. Madame Merle tells Isabel that Ralph was the one who gave her the inheritance money.<PARAGRAPH>Isabel retorts that it is Madame Merle she has to thank for her misery, not whoever gave her the money.<PARAGRAPH>Madame Merle concedes that Isabel is unhappy, but claims that she is far less happy.
