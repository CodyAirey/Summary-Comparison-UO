{"name": "Chapter 29", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820051943/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmLordJim38.asp", "summary": "Marlow remembers more about Jewel, especially her pale complexion and jet black hair. He also sees her furtive glances at Jim, while he spoke to Marlow. She loved Jim jealously and possessively, as Jim did her. Her mother had taught her to read and write, and she learned a bit of English from Jim. As a result, she mixed being shy with being bold. Marlow returns to Jim's early history in Patusan. When he left Doramin's house, he went to live with Cornelius, whom he would soon be replacing as manager. In Cornelius' house, Jim was very uncomfortable because he felt his resentment. Cornelius' house was in ruins; the roof had fallen in and the storehouse was filled with rats. Half the time Jim got no food. His physical misery coupled with Raja Allang's threats to kill him made the first six weeks in Patusan were very unpleasant for Jim.", "analysis": "Notes The romance of Jim and Jewel takes place in a setting filled with intrigue and fear. Threats on Jim's life are frequent. As a result, Jewel is a calming influence in his life. Her total devotion to Jim is obvious. He has the undivided love of both Jewel and Tamb'Itam. Yet Marlow feels that he \"is imprisoned within the freedom of his power.\" Jim tries to forget his past, but it is of no use; it still comes back to haunt him. He cannot tell the Malay people why he cannot return home. According to Conrad, it is not possible to start life totally afresh."}
