{"name": "Act 4, Scene 4", "summary": "Inside the house, Pandarus tries to calm down Cressida.Troilus enters and breaks the bad news.<PARAGRAPH>He promises to love her forever as he holds her in his arms. (Even Pandarus is moved by this display of emotion.)<PARAGRAPH>Troilus and Cressida exchange love tokens.<PARAGRAPH>He gives her a \"sleeve\" and she gives him a glove. (Got those highlighters handy? These love tokens are important. Almost as important as the handkerchief that Othello gives Desdemona in  Othello.)<PARAGRAPH>As our lovebirds say goodbye, Troilus keeps asking Cressida to be faithful to him and promises to come see her that night.<PARAGRAPH>Cressida worries that he doesn't trust her and Troilus promises that it's not  her he's worried about\u2014it's those young Greek guys who are the problem. You know.\nOh, and just in case she was wondering, he's totally not going to cheat on her, either.<PARAGRAPH>Aeneas and Diomedes say it's time for Cressida to go.<PARAGRAPH>Troilus begs Diomedes to \"use her well\"... or else. (Whoops! Troilus means he wants Cressida to be treated well but the phrase he uses makes it sound like he's giving the Greeks permission to \"use her\" sexually.)<PARAGRAPH>Diomedes snickers and promises that they'll take  great care of her. (If you know what we mean.)<PARAGRAPH>As Troilus walks with Cressida and Diomedes to the port, a trumpet announces that Hector and Ajax are about to rumble. Hm, sounds like the plots might be about to converge.<PARAGRAPH>Paris and Aeneas run off to watch the two guys throw down.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219191630/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/troilus-cressida/summary/act-4-scene-4"}
