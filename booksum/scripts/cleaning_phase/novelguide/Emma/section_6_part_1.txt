{"name": "volume 2, Chapter 19", "summary": "Chapter 19: Emma and Harriet are out walking, and Emma thinks of paying a visit to the Batses, in order to get Harriet's mind off of Mr. Elton. Emma does not think that they would have received a letter from Jane Fairfax recently, so does not think that she will have to suffer through it being read to her, but she is wrong. Miss Bates, who speaks quite fast and jumps from one subject to the other in a breath, cannot tell Emma enough about Jane. She tells her that because the Campbells  are going to Ireland to see their newly married daughter, she will be coming to stay with them at least three months. Through all of the rambling on of Miss Bates, Emma learns that Jane has been ill, and Emma convinces herself that something is going on between Jane and Mr. Dixon, the husband of the Campbell's daughter. While Emma does have to hear everything that was contained in the letter, she does manage to leave the Bates house before the letter is actually read", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210421073237/http://www.novelguide.com/emma/summaries/chap19-21"}
