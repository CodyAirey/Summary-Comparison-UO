{"name": "Volume II, Chapter Seven \u2013 Monseigneur in Town", "summary": "We\u2019re back in France.  Getting whiplash yet? Just wait\u2026<PARAGRAPH>Our narrator describes the way that Monseigneur, a member of the French aristocracy, makes his hot chocolate in the morning.<PARAGRAPH>Actually, Monseigneur would never dream of making his own chocolate.<PARAGRAPH>He has servants to do that for him. Four servants, to be precise.<PARAGRAPH>Mocking the excess that this sort of lifestyle needs, our narrator talks about Monseigneur\u2019s life in very  broad strokes.<PARAGRAPH>Monseigneur remains convinced that the world has been created for Monseigneur and his pleasures.<PARAGRAPH>Anything that doesn\u2019t concern Monseigneur\u2019s pleasure is something Monseigneur will never be interested in.<PARAGRAPH>Wait, who is this Monseigneur guy, exactly?<PARAGRAPH>Well, he\u2019s sort of a conglomerate of all the aristocrats. See, the more we read, the less he seems like a real guy.<PARAGRAPH>For one thing, he doesn\u2019t have any other name than Monseigneur.<PARAGRAPH>For another, he\u2019s absolutely detestable\u2026and he\u2019s described in such vague terms that he seems to be standing in for an entire class, not a single person.<PARAGRAPH>Okay, he is also an individual character, but we don\u2019t learn that until later. For now, just  think of him as Aristocrat X.<PARAGRAPH>In Monseigneur\u2019s house, everyone dresses exquisitely. Gold and masques and wigs and silk stockings abound.<PARAGRAPH>That\u2019s all well and good, but when you compare all that shiny, fancy, expensive stuff with the rags that the poor people wear...well, you get the picture.<PARAGRAPH>Also, everyone seems to be pandering to Monseigneur all the time. Doctors, lawyers, government officials, and other forms of \"high society\" meet in his house to tell him how wonderful he is.<PARAGRAPH>Tonight Monseigneur heads to the opera.<PARAGRAPH>While he\u2019s there, a man appears.<PARAGRAPH>No one seems to like the man very much. He\u2019s cold, with a face \"like a fine mask.\"<PARAGRAPH>Even Monseigneur seems to want to ignore him.<PARAGRAPH>He leaves the opera and gets into his carriage, where he orders his driver to speed through the streets.<PARAGRAPH>The driver is as ruthless as Monsieur le Marquis (that\u2019s the guy). They fly through Paris.<PARAGRAPH>Suddenly, however, they come to a lurching halt.<PARAGRAPH>The Marquis\u2019 carriage has run over a small child.<PARAGRAPH>The father of the child, wild with grief, charges at the carriage.<PARAGRAPH>Some people pull him back in time.<PARAGRAPH>Monsieur le Marquis looks at him in disgust. He can\u2019t figure out what all the trouble is about.<PARAGRAPH>He throws the man a coin to pay for his dead child.<PARAGRAPH>One of the men in the crowd comforts the grieving father by saying that, had the child lived, he wouldn\u2019t have had a very good life anyway.<PARAGRAPH>Monsieur le Marquis asks the name of this \"philosopher.\"<PARAGRAPH>Defarge (the owner of the wine-shop, remember?) tells him his name.<PARAGRAPH>As the Marquis\u2019 carriage drives off, he throws Defarge another coin.<PARAGRAPH>Defarge throws it back.<PARAGRAPH>Furious, the Marquis calls the poor people dogs. He\u2019d run over all of them if he had his choice in the matter.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210115212823/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/tale-of-two-cities/summary/volume-2-chapter-7"}
