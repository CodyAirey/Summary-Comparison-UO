As the sun's rays \"lace the severing clouds,\" Juliet wishes the sound of the morning lark were actually the call of the nightingale. Juliet tries to deny the arrival of the coming day to prolong her time with Romeo. Their language is passionate and intense as Romeo agrees to stay and face his death. As in previous scenes, Romeo and Juliet's love flourishes in the dark, but daylight brings separation and ill fortune: Juliet says reluctantly, \"window, let day in, and let life out.\"\nAs Romeo descends the balcony, Juliet experiences a frightening vision of Romeo \"as one dead in the bottom of a tomb.\" This prophetic image will prove true in the final scene when Juliet awakens from her drug-induced slumber to find Romeo dead on the floor of the Capulet tomb. Once again, images of love and death intertwine, infecting the joy of their wedding night with the foreshadowing of their coming deaths.\nLady Capulet, unaware that Juliet grieves for Romeo's banishment rather than the death of Tybalt, tries to comfort her daughter with her plans to avenge Tybalt's death by poisoning Romeo. The speech is full of dramatic irony since Lady Capulet's hope of poisoning Romeo anticipates the method he chooses to take his own life in the final act of the play. Although Romeo drinks the poison by his own hand, it is the hatred, driven in part by Lady Capulet that gives him cause.\nFar from a loving, maternal figure, Lady Capulet is cold and vengeful. She, like Tybalt, is prepared to continue the feud without regard to the authority of the Prince. Lady Capulet is brutally calculating \u2014 her venomous ire at Juliet's refusal to marry Paris leads her to say that she wishes \"the fool were married to her grave.\" Once again the image of Juliet's grave as her wedding bed anticipates the lovers' tragic reunion in death. It is as if Lady Capulet, by her single-minded focus on the family feud, condemns her own daughter to her fate.\nJuliet's interaction with both her mother and her father in this scene confirms the failure of parental love because their sole concern is with a socially acceptable marriage that will improve the wealth and status of the Capulet family rather than the happiness of their daughter.\n<PARAGRAPH>When Capulet refused, in Act I, Scene 2, to consent to his daughter's marriage to Paris unless she also was willing, he seemed concerned for Juliet's welfare. Such parental concern altogether evaporates into authoritarian, patriarchal ranting as Capulet shouts epithets, calling Juliet \"baggage\" and \"carrion\" for refusing his order. Capulet now uses Juliet's youth to mock her reluctance to marry, calling her a crying child and whining puppet. Capulet has degraded his daughter to chattel \u2014 an item to be brokered for value. In his fury, Capulet threatens Juliet with violence and disinheritance if she continues to disobey him, \"hang! Beg! Starve! Die in the streets! / For by my soul I'll ne'er acknowledge thee.\"\n\nCapulet's sudden transformation from seemingly concerned parent to vengeful adversary illustrates his tendency toward impulsive, cruel, and reckless behavior. These tendencies may have contributed to the origination of the feud itself. He has shown such tendencies previously \u2014 he wanted to engage the Montagues in a sword fight using his long sword; he viciously denounced Paris for wishing to duel Romeo at the masquerade ball; and now he has turned on his only daughter with threats of disinheritance. He literally places her in a \"nothing to lose\" position and thereby encourages the defiance he resents so mightily.\nWhile Juliet's parents react with extreme bitterness, Juliet handles herself with striking maturity. No longer the dutiful teenage daughter of the Capulets, she is a young woman, a bride, a wife. Her answers are skillfully truthful yet pragmatically deceptive. In response to her mother's desire to have Romeo killed, Juliet remarks that she \"never shall be satisfied / With Romeo, till I behold him \u2014 dead.\" Juliet's mother interprets this as anger over Romeo killing Tybalt. However, in the Elizabethan vernacular, a man's death also means his sexual climax. Since Juliet has just ventured into the realm of physical love, she desires it again \u2014 both as a youthful desire for pleasure as well as a mature yearning for further spiritual contact with  Romeo.\nThe Nurse, who has been more  of a mother  figure to Juliet than her biological mother, fails Juliet at this critical moment. To comfort Juliet in her desperate situation, the Nurse offers her an easy solution \u2014 marry Paris and forget the \"dishclout\" Romeo. This amoral recommendation betrays Juliet's trust and indicates the Nurse's inability to understand the passionate intensity and spiritual nature of Romeo and Juliet's love. After all, the Nurse regards love as a temporary, physical relationship, and she sees Juliet's marriage to Paris in entirely practical and economic terms.\nThe Nurse's failure to stand up for Juliet in the face of Capulet's onslaught is also understandable. She lacks Juliet's latitude to defy the Capulets. Although a loyal servant, the Nurse is not family and is keenly aware of her subordinated social position. She has been instrumental in facilitating Juliet's secret marriage and now seeks to cover the liabilities of her actions.\nEach member of Juliet's primary family has abandoned her. Still a young person in need of an older person's support, she flees to the Friar as a source of aid and counsel. Juliet's isolation is nearly complete, and yet she is calm and resolute, as she determines to die rather than enter into a bigamous marriage with Paris: \"If all else fail, myself have power to die.\"\nGlossary\n\nnight's candles the stars.\n\nCynthia's brow the moon.\n\ncare desire.\n\nhunt's-up morning song used to wake huntsmen and, more traditionally, a newly married bride.\n\nrunagate fugitive (runaway).\n\ndram potion.\n\nwrought arranged for.\n\nmistress minion spoiled hussy.\n\nhurdle a kind of frame or sled on which prisoners in England were drawn through the streets to execution.\n\nhilding a low, contemptible person.\n\nrate to scold severely; chide.\n\nsmatter to utter or gossip; an onomatopoeic word like \"chatter.\"\n\ndemesnes the land around a mansion; lands of an estate.\n\npuling fool whimpering child.\n\nmammet doll or puppet.\n\nchallenge claim.\n\ndishclout a cloth for washing dishes.\n\nbeshrew to curse: mainly in mild imprecations.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201109215341/http://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/r/romeo-and-juliet/summary-and-analysis/act-iii-scene-5"}
