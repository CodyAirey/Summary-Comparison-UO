{"name": "Chapter 9", "summary": "Chapter 9: Ellen tells Catherine to be quiet, as Joseph is near and that means Heathcliff will be coming. Catherine is worried that Heathcliff may have heard her and says that she will never forsake Heathcliff. She would not marry Edgar if it meant that she and Heathcliff would be separated. She thinks that if she married Heathcliff they would be beggars, and if she marries Linton, she can help Heathcliff to rise and get him away from her brother. When Joseph comes in looking for Heathcliff, Ellen calls for him outside but gets no answer. She then tells Catherine that he had heard some of what she said, and she gets frightened. Catherine runs outside to look for Heathcliff, and finally comes back, saying she will not go upstairs until she gets to talk to him. She paces the floor, and they all wait, and Catherine stays outside crying when it starts to rain. At midnight, the storm comes, and the wind is violent. Ellen tries to talk Catherine into taking off her wet things and going to bed, but she won't. The next morning Catherine is quite distraught over Heathcliff and is in fact quite ill. Mrs. Linton comes to visit, and insists that Catherine be taken to Thrushcross Grange until she is well. Later she and her husband both catch the fever though, and die within days of each other. When Catherine comes home, she is saucier and more passionate than ever, and nothing has been heard of Heathcliff since the night he left. Three years later Catherine and Edgar are married. Ellen accompanies Catherine to Thrushcross Grange, and is quite sad to leave five-year-old Hareton behind. Mrs. Dean stops her story, realizing how late it is", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210213004212/https://www.novelguide.com/wuthering-heights/summaries/chapter9-10"}
