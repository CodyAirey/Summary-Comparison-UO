{"name": "Chapter 15", "summary": "As Chillingworth returns to his task of gathering herbs, Hester watches him.<PARAGRAPH>Is she imagining the shadow following him? Can such an evil man actually heal anyone? Or will the herbs become poison, because his hatred ruins everything around him?<PARAGRAPH>Hester declares that she hates him, even if hatred is a sin.<PARAGRAPH>She can't believe she ever agreed to marry Chillingworth, and she actually gets kind of mad at him for convincing her that she'd be happy with him.<PARAGRAPH>In fact, she decides that he's done more wrong to her than she's done to him.<PARAGRAPH>All this time, Pearl has been entertaining herself by dressing up as  a mermaid with a seaweed scarf, mantle, and headdress\u2014and a seaweed \"A\" on her chest.<PARAGRAPH>Hester asks Pearl if she even knows that Hester's letter means.<PARAGRAPH>Yep\u2014and the minister keeps his hand over his heart for the same reason.<PARAGRAPH>How does she know this? Pearl says that she's said everything she knows\u2014but Chillingworth knows a lot more.<PARAGRAPH>Smart girl.<PARAGRAPH>Pearl takes her mother's hands, and Hester realizes that Pearl is growing up into kind of a nice girl. Maybe they can be friends now.<PARAGRAPH>As they stand there, Pearl asks her mother what the letter means and why Dimmesdale keeps his hand over his heart.<PARAGRAPH>But Hester can't tell her, even if it would make Pearl sympathetic. Instead, she does  the knee-jerk adult thing of saying that there are some things kids should ask.<PARAGRAPH>As to why she wears the scarlet letter, she says, \"I wear it for the sake of its gold thread\" (15.26).<PARAGRAPH>That's the first time she's lied about it, and she can feel the evil creeping in.<PARAGRAPH>Like any kid told not to ask questions, Pearl\u2026 continues to ask questions, until Hester finally snaps at her.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20211014221130/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/scarlet-letter/summary/chapter-15"}
