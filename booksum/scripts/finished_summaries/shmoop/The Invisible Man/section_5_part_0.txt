Yum. Mr. Hall has to go back upstairs to get some sarsaparilla to cover the taste of the watered-down beer . On his way, he notices some strange things: the front door is unlocked and the stranger isn't in his room. The lady of the house, Mrs. Hall, comes to check on the situation in the stranger's room. She peeks in and, after a few sneezes, the blankets and pillows start flying around the room, and the furniture starts banging around. Mrs. Hall immediately assumes that the stranger has put ghosts into her furniture. Some of the villagers - including Sandy Wadgers, the blacksmith, and Mr. Huxter, the general shop owner - get involved in the mystery of the stranger's disappearance and the haunted furniture. With so many people, not much gets done: \"The Anglo-Saxon genius for parliamentary government asserted itself; there was a great deal of talk and no decisive action\" . Zing! Take that, parliamentary government. Finally, the stranger comes out of his room and demands to be left alone. Huh?", "analysis": ""}
