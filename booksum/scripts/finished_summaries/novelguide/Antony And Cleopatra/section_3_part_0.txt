Antony thanks him for the treatment he gave his mother when she fled Italy during the skirmish between his brother and Caesar. The men go off to feast but Enobarbus stays and talks with the pirate, Menas. Enobarbus tells him about Antony marrying Caesar's sister but says that he thinks the marriage will not cement their relationship, but push them apart. Act 2, Scene 7: Pompey throws a feast for the Roman leaders on his boats. While everyone drinks, Menas tells Pompey he can make him the king of the world. Pompey asks how, and Menas states that he could kill all of the leaders while they are on the boat.
