It's awfully gloomy: \"like all that pertains to crime, it seemed never to have known a youthful era\" (1.2).<PARAGRAPH>There's a wild rose bush growing along the side of the door that serves as a blessing to all criminals who enter the prison.<PARAGRAPH>Random, we know. But just imagine you were a criminal in Puritan Boston on a dreary spring day and, right before you're tossed in  the clink, you see a beautiful, blood red rosebush. Would your day not be that much lighter?<PARAGRAPH>No? Yeah, we're not sold on it either.<PARAGRAPH>The townspeople believe that the wild rose bush at the prison door sprang up the moment Anne Hutchinson entered the prison.

We've got whole section on her.)", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20211014221130/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/scarlet-letter/summary/chapter-1"}
