They walk to Lady Catherine's, and Sir William and Maria are quite nervous. Mr. Collins admires and compliments everything, and Lady Catherine is gratified by the admiration. After dinner Lady Catherine asks Charlotte about domestic concerns, giving her advice on even the smallest details about running her house. She then asks Elizabeth many questions, and is quite surprised to find out that they had no governess in a house with five girls.
