{"name": "Chapter 42", "summary": "We're back to Scott's \"Old Play\" for the epigraph of this chapter. The speaker of these lines describes a funeral ceremony.<PARAGRAPH>King Richard and Ivanhoe enter Coningsburgh Castle.<PARAGRAPH>At Athelstane's funeral there are about a dozen representatives of old Saxon families from the area.<PARAGRAPH>When King Richard enters the room, Cedric recognizes him as the Black Knight.<PARAGRAPH>Ivanhoe hides his identity from his father.<PARAGRAPH>Cedric guides the two men into a chapel, where there is a woman dressed in black.<PARAGRAPH>This is Edith, Athelstane's mother.<PARAGRAPH>Cedric introduces Edith to \"these [...] worthy strangers\" (42.9).<PARAGRAPH>He especially draws her attention to the Black Knight, as a noble defender of the Saxons.<PARAGRAPH>Cedric guides his two guests to another room.<PARAGRAPH>There are about twenty Saxon women there.<PARAGRAPH>Rowena and three other girls are singing a hymn for Athelstane's soul.<PARAGRAPH>Cedric then leads the two men to a room where they can stay for the night.<PARAGRAPH>The Black Knight reminds Cedric that he owes him a favor.<PARAGRAPH>Then the Black Knight reveals that he is King Richard I.<PARAGRAPH>Cedric refuses to bow to a Norman.<PARAGRAPH>King Richard promises that he is equally king of the Normans and the Saxons.<PARAGRAPH>He is not the <em>rightful </em>King of England, Cedric answers.<PARAGRAPH>King Richard asks if there are any other options Cedric has in mind.<PARAGRAPH>Cedric is angry that King Richard is mocking him with Athelstane's death, since Athelstane was the last living Saxon royalty.<PARAGRAPH>Cedric recognizes that King Richard will stay king no matter what he says.<PARAGRAPH>King Richard calls in his favor. He wants Cedric to forgive his son.<PARAGRAPH>Cedric then recognizes that his second guest is none other than Ivanhoe.<PARAGRAPH>Ivanhoe throws himself at his father's feet.<PARAGRAPH>Cedric agrees to forgive his son.<PARAGRAPH>But he reminds Ivanhoe that Rowena has to stay in mourning for Athelstane for two years, according to Saxon custom.<PARAGRAPH>Just then, out of nowhere, appears... Athelstane! He's alive!<PARAGRAPH>He tells his story:<PARAGRAPH>Athelstane was not killed by Bois-Guilbert, but only knocked unconscious.<PARAGRAPH>He wakes up in an open coffin at the nearby Church of Saint Edmund's.<PARAGRAPH>Instead of letting him go, the monks of the church keep Athelstane a prisoner.<PARAGRAPH>Since Athelstane has no heir, the monks think <em>they </em>will be able to inherit his fortune.<PARAGRAPH>Of course, they can't inherit if Athelstane is still alive, hence the forced imprisonment.<PARAGRAPH>Athelstane sits for three days in the basement of the church, chained to the wall with only bread and water to drink.<PARAGRAPH>When the monks leave their church to go to Athelstane's funeral, a drunk friar comes down the stairs.<PARAGRAPH>He leaves behind some wine and meat for Athelstane, instead of the usual water and bread.<PARAGRAPH>Cheered by this better food, Athelstane starts pulling at his chains, and eventually he breaks free.<PARAGRAPH>Athelstane sneaks upstairs and finds two men drinking.<PARAGRAPH>One of them is the outlaw Friar, who tries to hit Athelstane.<PARAGRAPH>Athelstane knocks him out and steals a horse from the stables to make his escape.<PARAGRAPH>Now Athelstane wants to kill the monks of the Church of Saint Edmund for revenge.<PARAGRAPH>Cedric introduces Athelstane to King Richard.<PARAGRAPH>Athelstane immediately swears loyalty to the King.<PARAGRAPH>Athelstane's mother and Cedric are both angry that he won't try to get his rightful throne back.<PARAGRAPH>But Athelstane wants no part in plots for the kingdom. That's what got him imprisoned by the monks in the first place.<PARAGRAPH>All he wants is a comfortable life on his own lands.<PARAGRAPH>(Oh, and he also wants to execute the leader of the monks at St. Edmund's.)<PARAGRAPH>Athelstane tells Cedric that Rowena is in love with Ivanhoe.<PARAGRAPH>When they all look around, they see that Ivanhoe has disappeared.<PARAGRAPH>Apparently a Jewish man came by with a message for him. Ivanhoe put on his armor, took Gurth, and left the castle.<PARAGRAPH>Rowena is so embarrassed by Athelstane revealing her feelings for Ivanhoe that she leaves the room.<PARAGRAPH>King Richard, who finds out where Ivanhoe has gone, also takes off.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210614173333/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/ivanhoe/summary/chapter-42"}
