{"name": "Chapter 6", "summary": "Mrs. Grose, bless her heart, immediately sides with the Governess, and doesn't question what she saw. They decide that they will do their best to shelter the children.<PARAGRAPH>It becomes clear to the Governess that Quint was there looking for Miles . The two women wonder what would happen if the ghost appeared to the children, and they think that this is what Quint wants.<PARAGRAPH>The Governess decides that she will try and intercept the ghost, in a manner of speaking, and therefore protect the children.<PARAGRAPH>The fact that the children never mentioned Quint seems strange to the Governess; Mrs. Grose says that Flora was too young to remember, but that Miles would know.<PARAGRAPH>Apparently Miles and Quint were close - the implication is that they were too close . Quint was apparently \"too free\" , not just with Miles, but with everyone.<PARAGRAPH>Quint's badness was pretty clear to everyone except the master, who had faith in his valet.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Grose admits that she was afraid of Quint's cleverness, and of the things he could do.<PARAGRAPH>The Governess practically accuses Mrs. Grose of not looking out for the children, to which the poor woman replies that she wasn't in charge of them - the master had placed Quint in charge of everything when he left, even the children.<PARAGRAPH>Over the following days, the women can't help but discuss their ghostly visitor. The Governess is sure that Mrs. Grose is still holding something back, but she's not sure what.<PARAGRAPH>The facts of Peter Quint's death are revealed to us - he died accidentally, as far as anyone could tell, having slipped and struck his head one night after leaving the pub.<PARAGRAPH>The Governess admits that she took a perverse kind of pleasure in working on this mystery - it makes her feel heroic and admirable. She betrays some rather egotistical feelings ], and is proud of her immediate response, which is to simply protect the children. She feels even more united with her charges, since they're all endangered by the same threat.<PARAGRAPH>The Governess decides that she will set herself up as a \"screen\"  between the children and the horrible things around them. She begins to watch the children even more closely, in a frenzy that's almost like madness. However, soon enough she has proof that even more is going wrong than she'd realized.<PARAGRAPH>One day, Flora and the Governess are frolicking outside, having left Miles inside to finish a book. The little girl plays by the edge of a pond as her teacher looks on.<PARAGRAPH>Suddenly, the Governess senses someone else watching them - she can't see this third person, but she can feel its presence. She immediately questions this person's right to be there; though she knows that there could be any number of people walking around the estate, but she's sure it's nobody that should be there.<PARAGRAPH>Terrified, the Governess looks at Flora, who apparently hasn't noticed this intruder. The little girl is still absorbed in her game, and is trying to construct a little boat from two pieces of wood.<PARAGRAPH>The Governess looks up to see who their creepy visitor really is.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210422041030/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/turn-of-the-screw/summary/chapter-6"}
