{"name": "chapter 16", "summary": "The travelers board the Rangoon. They have to travel \nthree thousand five hundred miles on this ship. Aouda becomes better acquainted \nwith Fogg and is amazed by his attitude. While he is very particular about catering \nto her needs he behaves like automation. Fogg assures Aouda that he will find \nher cousin for her in Hong Kong.<PARAGRAPH>The first part of the voyage passed in \nexcellent weather then they pass the Great Andaman and later the Straits of Malacca. \nFix is on the boat too and his aim is to arrest Fogg in Hong Kong. He keeps thinking \nabout that. He also thinks of telling Passepartout, that his master may be a robber. \nHr goes to the deck and strikes up a conversation with Passepartout. Passepartout \nis a little surprised to see Fix. But, he nevertheless tells Fix about his adventures \nin India. Fix learns that the young woman, Aouda, will be accompanying Fogg till \nHong Kong and no further.<PARAGRAPH>Judge Odadiah takes a note of the confession that had escaped \nPassepartout and condemns him to go to prison for 15 days and to pay a fine of \nthree hundred pounds. Fogg too is condemned to prison and is asked to pay a fine. \nFogg agrees to pay bail for himself and his servant. Passepartout is very disgusted \nwith the fact that his master has to pay such a large sum of money. After taking \nback his shoes, Passepartout follows Fogg out of the courtroom. They immediately \ngo to the Rangoon, the ship that was to leave for Hong Kong. Detective Fix is \nvery angry because of Fogg\u2019s excessive spending. Since a percentage on the recovered \nis assigned as a reward for the detectives, Fix is worried that by the time the \njourney ends and Fogg is caught, there will be a very negligible amount left.<PARAGRAPH>Notes\nIn this chapter \nwe don\u2019t see much of Fogg. The focus is on Aouda, Passepartout and most of all \non Fix.<PARAGRAPH>Aouda is slowly but surely getting very attracted to Fogg, but \nshe cannot understand his cold behavior towards her. He does everything to make \nher comfortable but he does it more as a duty, than anything else. She is puzzled \nby this eccentric man; as anybody who encounters him, would be. Passepartout, \nFogg\u2019s loyal servant tells Aouda more about his master\u2019s eccentric, yet noble \ncharacter.<PARAGRAPH>Some of the islands by which Rangoon passes by are described. \nThey are tropical forested islands and are beautiful.<PARAGRAPH>A large part of \nthe chapter is devoted to the perturbations in Fix\u2019s mind. He is confused and \ndoes not know how to deal with Fogg\u2019s arrest. We can see that he has a typically \nvicious mind, that of a detective. He is always plotting in order to obtain his \nobjective. Now, he plans to get closer to Passepartout in order to learn more \nabout the master. When he goes to meet Passepartout on the deck of the Rangoon, \nwe wonder why Passepartout does not smell a rat. But Passepartout is simple and \nna\u00efve and he tells Fix all about his adventures in Bombay without holding \nanything back. Fix is curious about the young woman-Aouda, travelling with Fogg \nand Passepartout. Passepartout tells Fix that Aouda will be handed over to the \ncare of a relative in Hong Kong. The detective would have possibly liked to hear \nthat she is being abducted and is disappointed when he is told that she is not. \nFix has only one purpose-to arrest Fogg and to win the reward money. We see that \nhe is greedy and small-minded and yet, he is not typically villainous.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141554/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Around_The_World_In_80_Days/Around_The_World_In_Eighty_Days21.html"}
