{"name": "Volume II, Chapter Fifteen \u2013 Knitting", "summary": "Folks are coming into the Defarges' wine-shop as early as six in the morning today.<PARAGRAPH>Our narrator reflects that it can't be because of the wine .<PARAGRAPH>There must be something else going on.<PARAGRAPH>In fact, there is. Monsieur Defarge walks into his shop, where everyone is drinking quietly.<PARAGRAPH>Once he greets his customers, however, the entire shop erupts into conversations.<PARAGRAPH>Defarge saunters over to a table where a man from the country sits silently.<PARAGRAPH>Pulling his wife over to the table, he announces that the man is a mender of roads from the country.<PARAGRAPH>Defarge calls the man \"Jacques.\" We all know what that means.<PARAGRAPH>Soon the man is headed out toward the back of the shop, ostensibly to visit an apartment that the Defarges can lease to him.<PARAGRAPH>Once he's outside, Defarge calls the other three Jacques. They all follow the mender of roads into the garret where Dr. Manette stayed when he was in Paris.<PARAGRAPH>Nervous, the mender of roads asks Defarge where he should begin his tale.<PARAGRAPH>Defarge tells him to start at the very beginning.  It's a very good place to start.<PARAGRAPH>The mender of roads tells the assembled men that, a year ago, he was working on the road when he saw the Marquis' carriage pass by.<PARAGRAPH>That wasn't too unusual. What was unusual, however, was that a man was hanging off of the bottom of the carriage.<PARAGRAPH>Later, the Marquis asked the mender of roads what the man looked like. The mender recounts that he answered truthfully, saying that the man was tall as a ghost.<PARAGRAPH>The Jacques group scoffs at the honesty of the mender of roads.<PARAGRAPH>They would have lied to the Marquis.<PARAGRAPH>Enough interruptions already. Back to the mender's story:<PARAGRAPH>Later the next day, the mender of roads was working on roads again.<PARAGRAPH><PARAGRAPH>While he was working, he saw the same stowaway.<PARAGRAPH>This time, however, the tall man was a prisoner. Six guards hauled him down the road in chains.<PARAGRAPH>Describing the way that the soldiers tortured the prisoner, the mender of roads finally says that the prisoner was sent to the jail.<PARAGRAPH>He didn't remain there long, though.<PARAGRAPH>Before the mender of roads continues with the story of the prisoner, he spends some time discussing the way that rumors about the prisoner's fate circulated through the village.<PARAGRAPH>Execution? An official stay of execution? Life imprisonment? No one knew what his fate was going to be.<PARAGRAPH>After a few days, the prisoner was dragged into the village.<PARAGRAPH>The guards hanged him at midday.<PARAGRAPH>The gallows was erected over the town well. Because official orders insisted that the body remain where it was hanged, the town well is now polluted.<PARAGRAPH>Telling his tale, the mender of roads seems to get disgusted and angered all over again.<PARAGRAPH>He erupts in a violent declaration of anger at the injustice of this hanging and the injustice of polluting the well.<PARAGRAPH>Defarge pauses for a second, then asks the multiple Jacques what they think.<PARAGRAPH>They agree that the perpetrators of this crime should be \"registered\" in their records as people who should be destroyed.<PARAGRAPH>Jacques Two pauses to ask if anyone will ever be able to steal the group's register.<PARAGRAPH>Defarge scoffs. Madame Defarge keeps the register in her knitting.<PARAGRAPH>No one could decipher it, even if they knew what it was supposed to be.<PARAGRAPH>Defarge announces that the mender of roads plans to stay in Paris for a few days.<PARAGRAPH>Apparently he wants to see the King and Queen.<PARAGRAPH>The rest of the group is aghast. The mender of roads is a fan of royalty? How can he be trusted?<PARAGRAPH>Defarge calms the group down. Give the man a little taste of the way the royals behave, he reminds the Jacques group, and he'll be a fierce soldier against them in the future.<PARAGRAPH>The next day, the mender of roads and the Defarges head over to the royal procession.<PARAGRAPH>The mender cheers wildly as the King and Queen pass.<PARAGRAPH>Defarge mutters in Madame Defarge's ear that this man is exactly the sort of peasant they need around.<PARAGRAPH>He'll convince the King and Queen that their reign will last forever.<PARAGRAPH>That way, they'll be all the more surprised when revolution comes.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210115212823/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/tale-of-two-cities/summary/volume-2-chapter-15"}
