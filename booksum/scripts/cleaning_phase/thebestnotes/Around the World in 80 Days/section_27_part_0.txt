{"name": "chapter 23", "summary": "The next morning \nPassepartout is famished and resolves that he just has to get himself something \nto eat. Before becoming a strolling artist, he decides to change his garments \nfor old clothes. He gets into a Japanese robe and has a small breakfast. While \nmoving towards the docks, he sees an immense placard carried by a sort of clown. \nFollowing the clown, he reaches Honorable Batulcar's establishment, who is the \nmanager of a troupe of buffoons, jugglers, clowns, acrobats and gymnasts.<PARAGRAPH>Passepartout finds employment with Batulcar as a Jack-of-all-work and he is happy \nbecause within a week, he would be on his way to San Francisco with the rest to \nof the troupe. He was to lend the support of his shoulders in the making of the \n'human cluster' accompanied by the Long Noses of the god Tingou. This is a part \nof the performance in a large hall. When it is the chance for the 'human cluster' \nPassepartout takes his place at the bottom of the pyramid. But when he sees his \nmaster in the audience, he moves away and the human structure collapses. Honorable \nBatulcar is furious but his wrath is silenced by Fogg who throws some banknotes \nto him. Fogg, Aouda and Passepartout manage to board the American boat, together \nonce again.<PARAGRAPH>Notes\nWe are with Passepartout in Yokohama \nagain. His adventures in this Japanese City form the main focus of this chapter.<PARAGRAPH>Passepartout, like his master is a never say die man who is capable of \nlooking after himself. We saw how Passepartout roughed out the day before in Yokohama. \nNow in his second day at Yokohama he starts fending for himself. After selling \nhis old clothes he gets some money, which he uses to eat something. Passepartout \ndecides to go and get some employment at the dock. On his way, he sees a poster \nthat interests him and he finds employment with a manager of a troupe.<PARAGRAPH>We know that Passepartout has lead a colorful and exciting life before joining \nFogg. We realize it even more now. We are told that he sings well and now we see \nthat he is acrobatic as well. He gets hired as a long nosed stuntman who has to \nbe a supporting pillar at the base of a human pyramid. We see an interesting character-the \nHonorable Batulcar. He makes a very interesting statement about his two reliable \nservants being his two hands. But he is just as greedy as the other people that \nFogg comes across.<PARAGRAPH>When Passepartout breaks the pyramid with his impatience, \nFogg recompenses Batulcar with some bank notes. We are glad as readers that Fogg \nand Passepartout are reunited. Fogg comes to see Honorable Batulcar's troupe and \nthat's where Fogg and Passepartout meet.<PARAGRAPH>Now Aouda, Fogg and Passepartout \naboard the American liner for America. They are on track once again and we wait \nto see how they will fare in their travels.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141554/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Around_The_World_In_80_Days/Around_The_World_In_Eighty_Days24.html"}
