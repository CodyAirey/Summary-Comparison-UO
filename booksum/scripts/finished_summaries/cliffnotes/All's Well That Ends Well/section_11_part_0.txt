They capture and blindfold him and speak in a hilarious nonsense language which he takes to be Russian -- that is, \"Throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo.\" To save his life, Parolles, as predicted, immediately volunteers to betray anyone and anything: Oh, let me live! And all the secrets of our camp I'll show, Their force, their purposes; nay, I'll speak that Which you will wonder at.", "analysis": "For Parolles, the Falstaffian mock-motto, \"Discretion is the better part of valor,\" seems to apply. There is no real surprise in his behavior, although his captors marvel at his self-knowledge: Parolles: What shall I say I have done? It must be a veryPlausive  invention that carries it.They begin to smoke me , anddisgracesHave of late knocked too often at my door.I find My tongue is too foolhardy.First Lord : This is the first truth that e'er thine ownTongue was guilty of.Second Lord: Is it possible he should know what he is, andBe that he is?  There is a sly joke embedded in this scene, in which the \"man of words\"  is tricked by a plot which makes use of some assorted syllables of a gobbledygook language that Parolles thinks is Russian."}
