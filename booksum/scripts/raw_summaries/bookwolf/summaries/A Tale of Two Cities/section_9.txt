{"name": "Book 2 Chapter 9", "summary": "Chapter 9: A Revolutionary Act<PARAGRAPH>Summary<PARAGRAPH>Charles Darnay, the Marquis' nephew arrives, saying that he wishes to renounce all ties to the family and to France. The Marquis shows his dislike for his nephew, who equally despises his uncle, so much so that he is in fear of the very name of Evremonde. Before they part, the Marquis asks about his relationship with Dr. Manette and Lucie and smiles mysteriously. The next day, the Marquis is found stabbed, with a note saying &#8216Drive him fast to his tomb. This, from Jacques'. This is one of the first acts of the Revolution, which will be in full flow in a few years time.<PARAGRAPH>Interpretation<PARAGRAPH>It is here that the plot thickens as the reader finds out that Darnay's real name is Evremonde, hated by the revolutionary movement, but he has renounced the evil acts of his uncle and, therefore, the family name, but the reader can sense that it might not be so easy for him to escape the mob.<PARAGRAPH>Dickens uses the knitting of Mme. Defarge to represent the spinning of fate or destiny. However, it will be made clear that this knitting has also a more practical use. Mme. Defarge is recording the names in her knitting of all those that are to suffer once the Revolution takes control. The list of names has no end, but we know that Evremonde is on that list. When she is asked what she is knitting, she replies 'shrouds'."}
