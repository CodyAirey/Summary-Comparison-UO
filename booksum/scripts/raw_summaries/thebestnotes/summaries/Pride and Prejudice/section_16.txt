{"name": "chapter 19", "summary": "The day after the ball, Mr. Collins proposes to Elizabeth, who wastes no time \n        in declining the offer. Mr. Collins, undeterred by Elizabeth\u0092s rejection, \n        replies that it is usual for young ladies to initially turn down a proposal \n        for marriage. He believes that Elizabeth really wants to accept and intends \n        to do so in the end; as a result, he repeats his proposal. Elizabeth declines \n        again, refuting his arguments. Mr. Collins, however, is blinded by conceit \n        and does not realize that the lady is truly not interested in him. Elizabeth \n        decides she will seek her father\u0092s help if this vulgar suitor continues \n        to believe her repeated refusals are really \"flattering encouragement\".", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025227/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Pride_And_Prejudice_Austen/Pride_And_Prejudice_Study_Guide13.html"}
