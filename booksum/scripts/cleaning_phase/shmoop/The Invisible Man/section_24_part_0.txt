For one thing, they know that Griffin wants to get to Marvel and his stolen books.<PARAGRAPH>Also, Griffin basically told Kemp his life story, so they have all that information. Kemp knows that they can keep him unstable by making sure he doesn't get a moment to eat or sleep. And of course, he knows that they can use dogs against Griffin.<PARAGRAPH>Kemp even suggests that they put powdered glass on the roads, but Adye objects that \"t's unsportsmanlike\" . At least someone's worried about that.<PARAGRAPH>Kemp counters that Griffin is inhuman, that \"e has cut himself off from his kind. His blood be upon his own head\" .
