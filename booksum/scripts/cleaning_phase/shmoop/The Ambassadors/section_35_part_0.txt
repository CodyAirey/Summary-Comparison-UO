{"name": "Book 12, Chapter 5", "summary": "Two days later, Strether visits Maria Gostrey one more time for his \"last separation\" . The two of them agree to have breakfast together, although they have it at noon, which is technically a brunch when you think about it.<PARAGRAPH>Strether tells Maria that the last thing Chad told him is that he  is \"exciting.\" Strether has never heard anyone call him this before. But Maria says that he excites her all the time. Frisky!<PARAGRAPH>Strether looks around Maria's place and says it's peaceful. Maria answers by saying that she wishes it were a place that Strether would like to be peaceful in. Which is about as straightforward as she could be about saying that she wants the two of them to shack up together.<PARAGRAPH>But Strether has written to Sarah Pocock and he plans on joining her in her trip back to Woollett. Um, what?<PARAGRAPH>At this point, Maria mentions that Strether never told her what the embarrassing object was that the Newsome family made all of their money off. Strether is about to tell her, but then she decides that she'd rather not know.<PARAGRAPH>Sheesh, thanks a lot Maria. Maybe some of the rest of us would like to know.<PARAGRAPH>Strether also says that he hopes that Chad won't go back to Woollett, and that if he does, it probably won't be for the money. Maria is aghast at the idea of Chad leaving Madame de Vionnet, but Strether admits that it's still a possibility.<PARAGRAPH>Strether also admits that even though he is going back to Woollett, things between him and Mrs. Newsome are completely finished.<PARAGRAPH>Strether finally mentions what he said to Chad about never leaving Madame. He says that he would curse Chad forever if he did it.<PARAGRAPH>And with that, Strether says that he's all tired out and that he really has nothing left to say about Paris or anything else, for that matter.<PARAGRAPH>Except for one thing , which is to tell Maria that she's the loveliest person he's ever met.<PARAGRAPH>And one final time, she asks him if he might stay and be with her .<PARAGRAPH>And the answer is no.<PARAGRAPH>Byeeee!", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219182819/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/the-ambassadors/summary/book-12-chapter-5"}
