{"name": "Part 4, Chapter 6", "summary": "Next up, Gulliver tries to explain the concept of greed to the Master Horse.<PARAGRAPH>He claims that England grows enough food to support its population comfortably, but because they want luxury, they must export what they grow in exchange for things that they don't need.<PARAGRAPH>This luxury \u2013 wine, rich food, too much sex \u2013 all leads the English to diseases, the likes of which the Houyhnhnms have never seen.<PARAGRAPH>Another group of people have arisen to treat these diseases \u2013 to profit off them \u2013 using fake potions to make people purge their insides.<PARAGRAPH>This group of people (doctors, of course) make so much profit on disease that they encourage people to think that they are sick even when they aren't.<PARAGRAPH>They also use their wisdom to poison people who have become inconvenient: when husbands and wives have gotten tired of their partners or sons have gotten fed up with their fathers, doctors can take care of the problem.<PARAGRAPH>The Master Horse wants to know what a \"Minister of State\" is (in American terms, something like a Cabinet Member for the President).<PARAGRAPH>Gulliver tells the Master Horse that the First Minister of State is someone totally without any emotion besides ambition for money and power.<PARAGRAPH>The chief qualifications for the First Minister of State are: (1) to know how to get rid of an inconvenient wife, daughter, or sister; (2) to betray the Minister who has come before you; (3) to shout endlessly against corruption at court (though, of course, Ministers always lie).<PARAGRAPH>Chief Ministers of State dedicate themselves to bribing and intimidating others to follow their orders.<PARAGRAPH>And Gulliver's tirade continues: he tells the Master Horse that the nobility in his country are educated to be lazy and ignorant, and that there is frequent mixing of classes that damages noble bloodlines.<PARAGRAPH>Despite their total uselessness, they still have authority over all lower-born people in the country.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210619223131/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/gullivers-travels/summary/part-4-chapter-6"}
