{"name": "chapter 5", "summary": "The narrator walks to chapel with the other students, but he feels isolated \n        from them; it is like he is guilty of some crime or great sin. In the \n        chapel, he seats himself on a hard pew and waits for the ceremony, a ritual \n        wherein rich white men are honored and praised for giving help to the \n        black students. Dr. Bledsoe sits among the honored white men, commanding \n        fear and admiration from all the students. Soon a black man walks to the \n        podium, commanding the same reverence and attention as Dr. Bledsoe. The \n        man, Reverend Homer A. Barbee, gives a sermon on the founder's life, comparing \n        it to the life of each student present. The sermon makes the narrator \n        feel ashamed for letting the events of the day get so far out of his control. \n        He resents the reverend for making him feel so guilty. As the sermon closes \n        and Reverend Barbee walks back to his seat, he falls. The narrator looks \n        into the preachers eyes and realizes that the man is blind. As the narrator \n        leaves the chapel, he anticipates that Dr. Bledsoe will be merciless after \n        hearing this sermon. He does not know what he will do if he has to leave \n        the school.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025232/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Invisible_Man_Ellison/Invisible_Man_Study_Guide09.html"}
