{"name": "Chapter 6", "summary": "After a gloomy journey, the Dashwoods arrive at Barton Cottage, their new home. It turns out to be a pretty nice place \u2013 it's not that impressive after their former grand abode at Norland, nor is it the romantic, picturesque story-book cottage they'd imagined, but it'll do.<PARAGRAPH>The Dashwood servants, who'd arrived earlier to set up the house, manage to cheer up the girls, and everyone actually feels OK about their new living situation.<PARAGRAPH>The family goes about its business settling in to the house and making plans for improvements (though they might be difficult, given that they don't have much money\u2026 thanks a lot, John and Fanny).<PARAGRAPH>The next day, the girls meet their landlord/cousin, Sir John Middleton. He's a nice guy \u2013 maybe not the most graceful or elegant, but definitely a kind and good-natured man.<PARAGRAPH>Sir John's wife, Lady Middleton, is certainly elegant and lovely to look at, but she's not as personable as her husband; she's kind of a cold fish.<PARAGRAPH>Fortunately, Lady Middleton brings along the couple's oldest son on their visit to the cottage \u2013 and when you've got a bunch of women cooing over a little kid, there's always something to talk about.<PARAGRAPH>The Middletons leave, after asking the Dashwoods to dinner at their house, Barton Park, the next day.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210421140324/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/sense-and-sensibility/summary/chapter-6"}
