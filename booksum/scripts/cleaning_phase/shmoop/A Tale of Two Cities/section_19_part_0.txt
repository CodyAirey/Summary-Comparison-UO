{"name": "Volume II, Chapter Fourteen \u2013 The Honest Tradesman", "summary": "Jerry and his son  are sitting outside Tellson's Bank late one afternoon.<PARAGRAPH>All of a sudden, a small crowd of people pass by the bank.<PARAGRAPH>Jerry  sternly informs his son that what they're about to see is \"a buryin'.\"<PARAGRAPH>In other words, the crowd is a funeral procession.<PARAGRAPH>Young Jerry's pretty psyched about the prospect of a little bit of entertainment.<PARAGRAPH>He cheers for the oncoming funeral. His father promptly boxes his ears.<PARAGRAPH>A funeral may be exciting, after all, but one should still respect the dead.<PARAGRAPH>As it turns out, there's only one person who's officially mourning the dead body.<PARAGRAPH>The rest of the crowd is just there to cheer that person on.<PARAGRAPH>C'mon, there weren't movies back then. What else were you supposed to do on a long, boring afternoon?<PARAGRAPH>As the crowd gets closer, the Crunchers realize that they aren't exactly cheering the mourner on.<PARAGRAPH>In fact, they're booing the dead guy.<PARAGRAPH>They seem to think that the dead guy was a spy. Nobody likes spies.<PARAGRAPH>Come to think of it, the crowd hates spies more than most other people.<PARAGRAPH>In fact, they hate spies so much that they turn into a mob. The plan, it seems, is to overturn the funeral carriage, take the body out, and derail the parade.<PARAGRAPH>Luckily, this plan doesn't work so well.<PARAGRAPH>Instead, the mob decides to become part of the funeral procession. They all load into the carriage  and head off toward the graveyard together.<PARAGRAPH>Oh, and did we mention that the dead guy  was named Roger Cly? Hmm. We didn't really mean to rhyme there. We're just too good.<PARAGRAPH>Cruncher and son  stick around after the funeral to chat a bit with the undertaker.<PARAGRAPH>When they get back to the bank, it's closed.<PARAGRAPH>Accordingly, they set out toward home.<PARAGRAPH>Arriving just in time for tea, the Crunchers meet up with Mrs. Cruncher on the road.<PARAGRAPH>Jerry immediately tells his wife that if his business ventures as an \"honest tradesman\" go wrong tonight, he'll know it was because she was \"flopping\" against him.<PARAGRAPH>Flopping = praying, remember?<PARAGRAPH>Hmm...what do business ventures have to do with funerals? This is all very mysterious.<PARAGRAPH>Jerry announces that he's going out tonight.<PARAGRAPH>He's going fishing.<PARAGRAPH>Jerry  immediately points out that his father's fishing rod is pretty rusty, which is strange, considering all the times that it's supposedly used.<PARAGRAPH>His father doesn't answer.<PARAGRAPH>Late that night, Young Jerry waits until his father leaves the house.<PARAGRAPH>He slips on his boots and follows his father down the road.<PARAGRAPH>Jerry Sr. meets with two other men; they head down toward...the graveyard.<PARAGRAPH>Jerry Jr. waits breathlessly as the three head into the graveyard.<PARAGRAPH>When they've gone in, he creeps up to the gate.<PARAGRAPH>Watching through a crack in the wall, Young Jerry sees the three men begin to \"fish.\"<PARAGRAPH>Funnily enough, though, they're not using fishing rods.<PARAGRAPH>In fact, they're using spades.<PARAGRAPH>And they're digging up the graves.<PARAGRAPH>Astonished, Jerry Jr. jumps up and runs down the road. He doesn't stop until he reaches his home.<PARAGRAPH>In the morning, Jerry Jr. awakens to the sound of his father beating his mother's head against the table.<PARAGRAPH>Lovely. Just lovely.<PARAGRAPH>Apparently, something went wrong the night before.<PARAGRAPH>Jerry, of course, blames his wife for the failure.<PARAGRAPH>As Jerry Cruncher and Young Jerry walk to Tellson's, Young Jerry asks his father what a \"Resurrection-Man\" is.<PARAGRAPH>Startled, the older man stops abruptly in the middle of the street.<PARAGRAPH>After thinking for a minute, he tells his son that a resurrection man is a tradesman.<PARAGRAPH>Young Jerry ponders over this information for a while.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, he declares that he'd like to be a tradesman when he grows up.<PARAGRAPH>Relieved, Jerry says that with hard work and a bit of luck, Young Jerry might just turn out to be a decent adult, after all.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210115212823/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/tale-of-two-cities/summary/volume-2-chapter-14"}
