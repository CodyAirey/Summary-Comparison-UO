Fenton's got a plan that involves the wives' plot to punk Falstaff that night in the woods at the haunted oak. Anne has promised both her parents that she'll run off that night and elope with the guy of their choosing. But! Instead of marrying one of those two chumps, Anne's going to run off and marry Fenton during all the confusion of the Falstaff prank. Fenton wants the Host to arrange for a \"vicar\" to meet these two crazy kids at the church so they can get hitched while everyone's busy humiliating Falstaff. The Host agrees and Fenton promises to give him some more money afterward.", "analysis": ""}
