{"name": "Act 2, Scene 1", "summary": "Act 2, Scene 1: Banquo and his son Fleance walk toward their rooms after all of the merrymaking is over. Banquo tells Fleance that he is unable to sleep because of his troubling thoughts. He is wondering if Macbeth will take fate into his own hands to try and realize the witches' prophecies. The pair meets up with Macbeth, who is also roaming the hallways. Banquo tells Macbeth of King Duncan's pleasure at having been so royally treated. He asks Macbeth if he has been thinking of the weird sisters; Macbeth falsely responds in the negative. Again, he asks Banquo to talk with him at a later date about the strange events of that night. It seems that Macbeth seeks an intelligent and compassionate friend like Banquo to be his confidante in crime. Macbeth summons his wife and suddenly finds himself clutching a dagger, which stuns him. He sees imaginary drops of blood on the dagger that he will use to kill Duncan. Lady Macbeth gives him the signal, and he proceeds towards Duncan's room to kill him", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210212063205/https://www.novelguide.com/macbeth/summaries/act1-scene7-act2-scene1"}
