{"name": "Chapter XL", "summary": "Chapter XL. The Wanderer Late one night, David runs into Mr. Peggotty, who says that he has been looking for Little Em'ly on the continent. Mr. Peggotty has come close to finding her a few times and has received a letter from her. In all, Little Em'ly has sent three letters containing money to the Peggottys. Mrs. Gummidge has replied to one of the letters, telling Little Em'ly that her uncle misses her terribly and will forgive her if she comes back. While Mr. Peggotty tells David this story, David sees Martha listening at the inn door. Martha disappears, and Mr. Peggotty goes off to a cheap inn where he can stay for the night before he sets off again on his journey", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210124215354/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/copperfield/section11/"}
