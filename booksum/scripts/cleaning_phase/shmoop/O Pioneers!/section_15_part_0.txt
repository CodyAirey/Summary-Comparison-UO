{"name": "Part 2, Chapter 11", "summary": "Emil comes home later that evening, without Carl. Alexandra is in her bedroom with the door closed.<PARAGRAPH>When Alexandra asks him where Carl is, without coming out of\nher room, he says they were stopped by Lou and Oscar on the way over, and the\ntwo of them wanted to have a chat with Carl.<PARAGRAPH>Alexandra and Emil sit down in the dark parlor. Emil\nannounces to her that he has decided to put off law school for another year, in\norder to \"look around\" for a year .<PARAGRAPH>Alexandra agrees, only she tells him not to go off looking\nfor land.<PARAGRAPH>When Alexandra asks whether he'll stay with her for the\nwinter, he says he's planning to head to Mexico as soon as the harvest is over.\nHe figures Lou and Oscar will be angry with him.<PARAGRAPH>Alexandra tells him that she has fought with the two of\nthem, but Emil barely hears her, as he sits thinking about Mexico.<PARAGRAPH>She tells him that they have fought about Carl, and that his\nbrothers are afraid that they won't be able to have some of her property.<PARAGRAPH>Emil thinks this is nonsense, but Alexandra presses him, to\nask whether he also thinks she doesn't have a right to change her lifestyle.<PARAGRAPH>Embarrassed, Emil says he doesn't think it's ridiculous,\nthat she should be able to do whatever she wants. He'd be surprised if she did\nmarry Carl, but it's not his business.<PARAGRAPH>Alexandra had hoped he would understand why she does want to\nmarry him, she tells him. Her life has been lonely, and Marie is the only\nfriend she's ever had.<PARAGRAPH>After she says this, Emil awkwardly takes her hand and tells\nher she should marry Carl, that he's a good guy, and that his brothers are just\nsuspicious of him because he's worldly and intelligent. He's sure Carl won't mind\nwhat they have to say to him. Alexandra isn't so sure.<PARAGRAPH>Carl comes back on his horse, and Emil escapes to go to his\nroom.<PARAGRAPH>He thinks about his sister's desire to marry Carl, and he\ncan't help thinking that it is a little ridiculous. He lies in bed and quickly\nstarts to think about Marie, wondering why she ran away with Frank, and how she\nis able to be so happy and pleased to be with other people all the time. He\nwonders why she has to like anyone else but himself.<PARAGRAPH>As he falls asleep, the narrator writes, his spirit crosses\nthe field and goes to Marie, as he dreams what it would be like if she loved\nonly him.<PARAGRAPH>As the chapter closes, we get an image of Emil at the\nUniversity dances, where he leans brooding against the wall, intimidating all\nthe girls. The only girl he ever thought about was Marie.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219131311/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/o-pioneers/summary/part-2-chapter-11"}
