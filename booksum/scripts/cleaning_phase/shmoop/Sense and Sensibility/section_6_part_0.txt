{"name": "Chapter 7", "summary": "Barton Park is a rather lovely place - Sir John and Lady Middleton have life pretty much figured out. It's both comfortable and beautiful, and both of them seem perfectly happy there. Each of them has a hobby - his is hunting, and hers is spoiling their children. It all works out.<PARAGRAPH>Lady Middleton delights in the elegance of her home, and Sir John loves just hanging out with people, so they're a pretty social pair; parties and balls are frequent occurrences in the Middleton home.<PARAGRAPH>The arrival of new friends, the Dashwoods, just tickles Sir John pink, and he's pleased to welcome them to his home.<PARAGRAPH>Also visiting Barton Park is Mrs. Jennings, Lady Middleton's hilariously cheerful mother. She's so cheerful, in fact, that nobody is quite sure what to make of her .<PARAGRAPH>A friend of Sir John's, Colonel Brandon, also joins the family for dinner. He's very serious, and a real gentleman, but Marianne and Margaret instantly dismiss him as being ancient .<PARAGRAPH>Compared to these other guests, Lady Middleton is particularly dull and unappealing. She only livens up when her bratty kids make an entrance.<PARAGRAPH>After dinner, Marianne is asked to play the piano - everyone loves it. The Middletons respond with enthusiasm , but Colonel Brandon, who obviously appreciates music as much as Marianne does, pays attention politely and respectfully. Marianne is forced to admit to herself that he's a good guy, despite his old age.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210421140324/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/sense-and-sensibility/summary/chapter-7"}
