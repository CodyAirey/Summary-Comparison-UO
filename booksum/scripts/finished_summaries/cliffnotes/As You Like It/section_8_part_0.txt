{"name": "Scene 6", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201123193643/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/a/as-you-like-it/summary-and-analysis/act-ii-scene-6", "summary": "In the last scene, we noted that a meal was being prepared for the duke and his men; in this scene, in contrast, no meal awaits Orlando and Adam as they wander through the forest. Adam says that he is too weak from hunger to go on, but his master comforts him by promising to find him a shelter and, afterwards, some food.", "analysis": "This scene serves to establish the fact that Orlando and Adam have arrived in the Forest of Arden, and it prepares us for Orlando's meeting with Duke Senior and the duke's company in the next scene. Because Orlando attends Adam so loyally and attentively, it raises the audience's estimation of him. He is young, but he exhibits a noble character, probably inherited from his father. As always, we note his concern and courtesy toward others. He is a gentle, good youth."}
