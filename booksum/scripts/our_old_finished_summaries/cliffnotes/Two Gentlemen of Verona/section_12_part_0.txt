As they take her away to their captain , she exclaims: 'O Valentine, this I endure for thee.\" Meantime, a session in which Proteus advises Thurio on his progress with Silvia is interrupted by the Duke, who tells them of Eglamour and Silvia's flight. They exist separately. Proteus: And I will follow more for Silvia's love Julia: Than hate of Eglamour, that goes with her. And I will follow, more to cross that love Than hate for Silvia, that is gone for love.", "analysis": "Shakespeare speeds up the plot by his usual technique of quickly interchanging scenes. The three here, a) Silvia fleeing; b) the Duke and others pursuing them; and c) Silvia's capture by outlaws, take up roughly seventy lines. The pleasant irony of Silvia's last \"despairing' line is obvious, as is much in this romantic tale."}
