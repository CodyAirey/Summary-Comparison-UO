He tries to explain the situation to people and no one listens to him. He also has no luck in finding Maggie a job since no one will hire her. The town wishes Maggie would either go live with Mrs. Glegg, who actually seemed to want her, or to just leave the town entirely. So Dr. Kenn finally hires Maggie to work as a governess for his own kids. Mrs. Tulliver goes back to live at the Mill again. This causes a new scandal though - everyone in town becomes convinced that Maggie has seduced Dr. Kenn and is making a move on him now that his wife has died. Not everyone buys this, though. Stephen's sisters are convinced that Maggie is still after him for his money. They write to Stephen about the scandal with Dr. Kenn, hoping Stephen will give Maggie up. Lucy meanwhile takes a vacation with Stephen's sisters. But the night before she leaves, Lucy sneaks out to see Maggie. Lucy tells Maggie that she forgives her and the two reconcile. Maggie tells Lucy to try to forgive Stephen and the two tearfully part as friends.", "analysis": ""}
