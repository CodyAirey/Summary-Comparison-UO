{"name": "Chapter 6", "summary": "Catherine and Isabella have known each other around ten days. They meet in the Pump-room, Bath's best hot-spot, for some gossip.<PARAGRAPH>Isabella gripes that Catherine kept her waiting forever. Catherine thought she made good time.<PARAGRAPH>The two discuss reading Anne Radcliffe's The Mysteries of Udolpho.  Catherine is reading it for the first time and is spoiler-free, so Isabella won't tell her plot points.<PARAGRAPH>Catherine says that she would spend her entire life reading Udolpho, except she wanted to see Isabella, so she tore herself away.<PARAGRAPH>Isabella gives Catherine a list of some of her favorite Gothic novels, thus ensuring that Catherine won't read anything particularly educational for at least a few months.<PARAGRAPH>Isabella switches topics and gossips about her friend Miss Andrews, who is not admired by men. Isabella is upset by this.<PARAGRAPH>Isabella refused to dance with some man unless he would admit Miss Andrews was beautiful.

Mrs. Morland does read novels, but not the Gothic ones that Isabella and Catherine enjoy.<PARAGRAPH>Isabella insists that she and Catherine dress the same for tonight's ball. She claims that men notice such things.<PARAGRAPH>After ragging on men in general for a bit, Isabella asks what type of guy Catherine finds attractive.<PARAGRAPH>Catherine flounders a bit and then settles on a guy with a bit of a tan. Isabella latches onto that and notes how that describes Henry Tilney.<PARAGRAPH>She then says that she herself likes fair complexions and then stops, saying she's giving too much away.<PARAGRAPH>Catherine is confused.<PARAGRAPH>Isabella says some men are bothering her and insists that she and Catherine move.<PARAGRAPH>The men depart soon after and Isabella now insists that she has to show Catherine a hat in a shop, so they take off in the direction the men walked.
