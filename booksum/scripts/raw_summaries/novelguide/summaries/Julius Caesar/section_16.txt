{"name": "Act 5, Scene 5", "summary": "Brutus and his soldiers, defeated in battle, stop to rest. Brutus makes it clear that he wishes to be killed. Clitus refuses, as does Dardanius. Then Brutus asks Volumnius, telling him that he has twice seen the ghost of Caesar and he knows his time to die has come. Volumnius also refuses. There are sounds of continuing battle, and Clitus, Dardanius and Volumnius flee. Brutus says he will follow. One man remains, Strato, and he holds Brutus's sword as Brutus runs on to it. Brutus dies.  \n\tThe victorious Antony and Octavius enter. Antony pays tribute to the dead Brutus by calling him the noblest Roman of them all.  \n\tAnalysis\n\tBrutus's suicide (even though it is something he said he would not do) is perhaps a nobler end than that of Cassius, who asked to be killed by one of his own men. Antony's praise of Brutus seems genuine, since he has no reason to lie, and accords with Brutus's view of himself.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201029024802/https://www.novelguide.com/julius-caesar/summaries/act5-scen5"}
