{"name": "Chapter 61", "summary": "David spends some time finishing up his book at his aunt's house.<PARAGRAPH>Sometimes David travels in to London to see Traddles, who is managing his business affairs.<PARAGRAPH>It turns out that Sophy has been training as a copy clerk to keep up with Traddles's work.<PARAGRAPH>David compliments Traddles and Sophy as being two of the happiest people in the world.<PARAGRAPH>Traddles agrees: he can't believe how happy he is.<PARAGRAPH>However, Traddles admits, the other day while he was in court he went back to his boyhood habit of drawing skeletons.<PARAGRAPH>This reminds David that he has received a letter from old Mr. Creakle, his headmaster.<PARAGRAPH>Apparently, Mr. Creakle is now a magistrate \u2013 which is like a local, small-time judge.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Creakle has invited David to come and see prison discipline in action.<PARAGRAPH>David suggests that Traddles accompany David to see Mr. Creakle.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Creakle is very kind to his prisoners \u2013 much kinder than he ever was to anyone else under his power.<PARAGRAPH>The ex-schoolmaster welcomes David to his prison as though they were great friends, and he does the same to Traddles.<PARAGRAPH>The secret Mr. Creakle relies on in his prison is total isolation, which leads the prisoners to repent their evil deeds.<PARAGRAPH>Despite Mr. Creakle's claims, when they actually walk through the prison as part of a tour group, David is pretty sure from the design of their cells that the prisoners get to speak to each other.<PARAGRAPH>One model prisoner is Number 27; a second is Number 28.<PARAGRAPH>Number 27 is very pious and holy, and frequently writes to his mother.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Creakle leads David to Number 27, who is patiently reading hymns.<PARAGRAPH>Number 27 is, of course, Uriah Heep.<PARAGRAPH>He asks how David and Traddles are.<PARAGRAPH>Uriah Heep tells them that he is very humble today.<PARAGRAPH>Heep claims that he is much more comfortable in prison than he ever was outside.<PARAGRAPH>Uriah tells the tour group that he deserves to be in prison as a consequence of his behavior, and that he must bear his punishment without grumbling.<PARAGRAPH>The tour group is very approving.<PARAGRAPH>They're next led to Number 28, and who should it be but Littimer!<PARAGRAPH>Littimer claims to be troubled by memories of his past deeds and sins.<PARAGRAPH>He says that he is perfectly happy.<PARAGRAPH>Littimer tells the group that he sees a gentleman among their number who he used to know. That gentleman should repent of his bad behavior before it's too late.<PARAGRAPH>You'd think that \"gentleman\" would clearly be David, but David notices a number of men in the group hiding their faces guiltily.<PARAGRAPH>Littimer then clarifies that the \"gentleman\" should tell the \"young woman who fell into dissolute courses\" (61.68) \u2013 i.e. Emily.<PARAGRAPH>He forgives her for leading him astray, before wishing them all a good day.<PARAGRAPH>They return to Uriah Heep.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Creakle asks if he needs anything.<PARAGRAPH>Uriah Heep wants to write to his mother; he is afraid that she is not safe.<PARAGRAPH>Heep wishes his mother had come to prison; in fact, he thinks everyone would be better off in prison.<PARAGRAPH>Uriah Heep promises Mr. Creakle that he is a changed man.<PARAGRAPH>Uriah then reminds David of his own violent impulses \u2013 why, he struck Uriah on the face once!<PARAGRAPH>(The whole tour group looks angrily at David.)<PARAGRAPH>But Uriah Heep claims that he forgives David, and he hopes that David and the Wickfields all repent.<PARAGRAPH>Uriah Heep has been sent to prison due to bank fraud.<PARAGRAPH>Littimer robbed a man he was working for, but he was turned in by a little person \u2013 Miss Mowcher!<PARAGRAPH>He injured Miss Mowcher quite badly, but she wouldn't let him go.<PARAGRAPH>David and Traddles both realize that there is no point in telling Mr. Creakle that Littimer and Uriah are lying hypocrites.<PARAGRAPH>They leave the pair of them to the prison system.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200929182814/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/david-copperfield/summary/chapter-61"}
