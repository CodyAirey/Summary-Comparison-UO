{"name": "Act 4, Scene 2", "summary": "We're introduced to two new characters, the schoolmaster Holofernes and Sir Nathaniel, the curate (country preacher).<PARAGRAPH>Holofernes is learned and enjoys talking. If he hasn't said something six different ways (four of them in Latin), he hasn't said it at all.<PARAGRAPH>Nathaniel seems to be a fan of this sort of thing. He compliments the schoolmaster's speech but disagrees with his assessment of the kill.<PARAGRAPH>Dull misunderstands their flowery language and references, which Nathaniel says in understandable since he's not educated. (That's the \"he hath not eat paper\"/\"he hath not drunk ink\" bit.)<PARAGRAPH>The three exchange a few more riddles (which mostly go over Dull's head), until Holofernes, inspired, offers \"an extemporal epitaph on the death of the deer\" (4.2.59).<PARAGRAPH>Holofernes has at it, delivering a little speech full of alliteration and wordplay. Nathaniel is impressed; Dull not so much.<PARAGRAPH>They are interrupted by Costard and Jaquenetta, who want them to read her letter from Don Armado.<PARAGRAPH>Well of course it's the wrong one! Nathaniel reads aloud Berowne's letter to Rosaline.<PARAGRAPH>Holofernes looks it over and gives it a big fat shrug. Nothing special, in his opinion. And was it really meant for Jaquenetta?<PARAGRAPH>She thinks so. But Holofernes reads the address and sees \"Rosaline.\" He advises Jaquenetta to take the letter to the King. She exits with Costard.<PARAGRAPH>Holofernes insults Berowne's letter a bit more and invites Nathaniel and Dull to dinner. They all exit.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210616204319/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/loves-labours-lost/summary/act-4-scene-2"}
