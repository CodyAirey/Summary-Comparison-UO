Indeed, White Fang gradually grows to love Scott. He never, however, outgrows his growl, even though a note of affection and contentment is now in it that was not present before. He grows to love Scott so much, in fact, that when Scott leaves on a trip, White Fang becomes physically ill-languishing, refusing to eat-and does not recover until Scott returns. One night after Scott's return, Beauty Smith stealthily approaches, attempting to steal White Fang back. White Fang viciously attacks Smith, who runs away in terror.", "analysis": ". This chapter expands on suggestions earlier in the book  that love is a necessary part of life: White Fang becomes \"aware of a certain satisfaction, as though some need were being gratified, as though some void in his being were being filled. \" In fact, White Fang's first experience of love marks \"the beginning of the end for White Fang-the ending of the old life and the reign of hate.\" To use religious language that London does not employ , White Fang is being \"born again.\" He is becoming, in the biblical phrase, a \"new creation\" thanks to Scott's love. London shows that love is the necessary element for rising above \"mere flesh-love of life\" . Interestingly, though, this new creation is advertisement not entirely discontinuous from the old. For example, notice that White Fang still growls, even though his growl now has a new undertone of love. The old has been, not obliterated, but transformed, perhaps one might say even exalted. In yielding himself to Scott-\"as though he said: 'I put myself into thy hands'\"-White Fang is \"in the process of finding himself\" ."}
