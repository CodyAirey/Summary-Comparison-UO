{"name": "Chapter 2", "summary": "Chapter 2: In the second chapter, Candide finds himself \"ejected from the earthly paradise\" to which he had grown accustomed. Drifting to a neighboring village, and now very cold and hungry, he stumbles across two recruiting officers of Frederick the Great standing outside a tavern. The two men seem enamored by Candide's height of five feet, five inches, and offer to buy him a meal. Trusting their kindness, Candide is reminded of Pangloss' philosophy, that all is for the best; he thinks that perhaps being exiled from the castle , may ultimately lead him to a better end after all. Soon, however, these newfound \"friends\" bind Candide with chains, and force him into the army, where he is beaten daily. At one point, Candide is at the point of being killed  when the King of the Bulgars passes and grants his pardon", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210213005525/https://www.novelguide.com/candide/summaries/chap1-2"}
