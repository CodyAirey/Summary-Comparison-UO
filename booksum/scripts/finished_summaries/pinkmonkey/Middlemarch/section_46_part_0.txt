{"name": "Chapter 47", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820035130/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmMiddle60.asp", "summary": "So far Will has tried to content himself with friends and activities far away from Dorothea. Now he begins to chafe at the separation from her and the tyranny of her hated husband. As a result, he decides to attend Lowick Church on Sunday morning sure of seeing the Casaubons there. He has none of the dishonest intentions of which Casaubon suspects him, but longs just to see her. Believing that she lives like a prisoner at Lowick, he feels his sympathy and support was necessary to her. At the church, he finds himself alone in the pew of some friends who are absent. Dorothea sees him and bows formally. Casaubon presides over the prayers and ignores him throughout. They both leave for their home. Will is crushed.", "analysis": "Notes The intensity of feeling between Will and Dorothea is shown increasing, as is Casaubons hatred. In fact, Casaubons hatred itself creates more sympathy for Will and disappointment in her husband in Dorotheas mind. The symbolism always associated with Will is reiterated here: \"as he sang, he looked like an incarnation of spring whose spirit filled the air - a bright creature, abundant in uncertain promises.\""}
