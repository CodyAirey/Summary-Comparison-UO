{"name": "Chapter 9", "summary": "Catherine is in a bad mood when she first arrives home, but she quickly gets over it.<PARAGRAPH>After a good night's sleep, Catherine decides that her goal for the day is to get to know Eleanor Tilney better. So she heads to the Pump-room in the hopes of finding her. Life was way hard in the days before cell phones and Facebook.<PARAGRAPH>Before heading to the Pump-room, Catherine settles down to read in the parlor.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Allen keeps up a nice running commentary about anything that pops into her head.<PARAGRAPH>Just after noon the Thorpes and James show up to hustle her off for a road trip.<PARAGRAPH>Catherine doesn't really want to go, but Mrs. Allen totally fails to pick up on the vibes Catherine is sending her way, and says she has permission to go.<PARAGRAPH>Catherine says hi to Isabella, who complains about how long they waited for her, and hops into the carriage with John.<PARAGRAPH>John tells her that his horse is spirited but that she shouldn't be frightened.<PARAGRAPH>Catherine is a bit frightened, but won't say so. But when they set off it is clear that the horse is very mild.<PARAGRAPH>When she comments on it, John assures her it is all because of his crazy awesome driving skills.<PARAGRAPH>Catherine thinks that John was a bit of a punk to scare her. She sits back to enjoy the ride.<PARAGRAPH>John asks Catherine about the Allens, namely how rich they are and how much time she spends with them.<PARAGRAPH>John then asks if Mr. Allen drinks a lot and Catherine says no.<PARAGRAPH>John gripes about how women are always so concerned about drinking.<PARAGRAPH>Catherine notes that there is a lot of drinking at Oxford, which John vehemently denies - a bit too vehemently really.<PARAGRAPH>Catherine gets the impression that they are all drunkards at Oxford now.

Catherine really should just hit him.<PARAGRAPH>John then hints that James' gig is a piece of junk and Catherine is worried he will break down and they'll have to call Triple A or something<PARAGRAPH>John insists it's not unsafe at all and is actually a very nice carriage. Catherine is confused as to why he would contradict himself and make things so ambiguous.<PARAGRAPH>John goes back to talking about horses again.
