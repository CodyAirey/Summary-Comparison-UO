A man wearing a travelling cap with a perky little tassel on top asks the kid if he's seen the man with a weed on his hat. Oh, man, has college kid seen him? Yeah. And he's none too pleased about it, either. Tassel figures Weeds must have disembarked. College kid figures it's good riddance. Tassel wishes he could have caught Weeds before he left. His company--the Black Rapids Coal Company, to be exact--made a lot of money recently, and he wants to pay it forward. Hold the phone. College kid's interest is piqued. If Tassel is selling, he's buying. There's a lot of back and forth here that basically amounts to this: Buying; really? Yes; gimmie. The two also talk about gloomy philosophers ruining everything with their downer attitudes. Tassel blames them for the fact that popular opinion has lost confidence in the stock market. Eventually, Tassel and the college kid go into a side room, then come back ostensibly having struck a deal. All we can say is, secrets don't make friends. When they come back, Tassel tries to get the college kid to invest in a new development called \"New Jerusalem.\" College kid is not interested. Tassel brings up Weeds again. College kid says shut it about that guy. Tassel ends with a comment about how as the college kid hardens his heart against others like Weeds, his brain softens.", "analysis": ""}
