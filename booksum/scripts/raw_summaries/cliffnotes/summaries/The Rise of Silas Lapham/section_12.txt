She tells Tom of the modest dinner party she has planned, and he realizes that his mother suspects the possibility of a romance deserving an appropriate dinner. He asks her not to give the party, but the invitations have been sent.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Lapham worries about how she will answer the invitation, how she will dress, and, most important, how her family will find something to talk about. Silas decides he must buy his first dress coat and debates over the need for gloves. Penelope refuses to go, believing it is a recognition dinner for Irene.
