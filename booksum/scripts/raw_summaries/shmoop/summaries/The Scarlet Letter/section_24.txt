{"name": "Chapter 24", "summary": "Of course, no one can agree on what actually happened at the scaffold.<PARAGRAPH>Some people say they saw a scarlet letter, similar to the one worn by Hester Prynne, engraved in Dimmesdale's flesh. Some think he minister etched the letter himself as a form of penance. Others think that Roger Chillingworth made it appear. And then some suggest that it appeared due to the \"ever active tooth of remorse\" (24.1).<PARAGRAPH>And then there are the eternal optimists, who claimed they didn't see anything at all and that there's no way Dimmesdale could have been Pearl's father.<PARAGRAPH>These people think that Dimmesdale chose to die in the arms of a fallen woman to demonstrate that we're all sinners in the eyes of God.<PARAGRAPH>That's, um, a lot of planning for a dying man.<PARAGRAPH>Anyway, the narrator tells us all that we should be honest, rather than hiding our worst traits and sins from the world.<PARAGRAPH>You know, like the fact that you wear the same socks two days in a row or never throw out leftovers?<PARAGRAPH>After Dimmesdale's death, Roger Chillingworth has no reason to live. He dies a year later and leaves all his property, in both England and in the U.S., to Pearl.<PARAGRAPH>This makes Pearl the richest heiress in the New World, which is awesome.<PARAGRAPH>It also means that Hester and Pearl can finally get out of town, which they do: one day, they just disappear from their cottage.<PARAGRAPH>Hester Prynne's story becomes legend\u2026 until, one day, years later, a tall woman in a gray robe comes to the abandoned cottage where Hester and Pearl had lived.<PARAGRAPH>As she goes in, she turns around long enough to display the scarlet letter on the bodice of her dress.<PARAGRAPH>Whoa! Hester's back!<PARAGRAPH>For the rest of her life, somebody sends Hester rich gifts, tokens, and ornaments\u2014so someone's obviously looking after her.<PARAGRAPH>The gossips also believe that Pearl is alive, married, and having kids, because they see Hester embroidering a baby garment.<PARAGRAPH>But wherever Pearl lives, Hester has decided that New England is her real home. As the narrator says, \"Here had been her sin; here, her sorrow; and here was yet to be her penitence\" (24.11).<PARAGRAPH>She wears her scarlet letter, even though she doesn't have to.<PARAGRAPH>But the letter isn't a stigma anymore. Instead, it's a sign of her respect.<PARAGRAPH>Instead of avoiding her, women actually seek her out for comfort and advice, and she helps them out with the wisdom she's gained through her years of suffering.<PARAGRAPH>Just like Oprah.<PARAGRAPH>So, finally, Hester gets her happy ending, right? Well, it depends on what you think of as \"happy.\"<PARAGRAPH>When she dies, she's buried near Dimmesdale... but not too near. And her gravestone, obviously, has a scarlet letter on it.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20211014221130/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/scarlet-letter/summary/chapter-24"}
