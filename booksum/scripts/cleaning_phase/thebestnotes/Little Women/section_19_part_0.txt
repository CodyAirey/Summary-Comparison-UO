{"name": "chapter 21", "summary": "Laurie wheedles the secret about Meg and Mr. Brooke out of Jo, then \n        plans a retaliation for having been left out. He composes a series of \n        letters, ostensibly from Mr. Brooks. In one letter he confesses his love, \n        and Meg answers by saying that she is too young to marry and prefers to \n        be friends for a long while. In the next letter, Laurie-under the absconded \n        identity-writes that he never wrote the first letter and regrets that \n        her \"roguish sister\" has taken liberty with their names. Laurie \n        is summoned and admits to the deviltry. He is chastised by Mrs. March \n        who swears him to silence about the whole affair.<PARAGRAPH>Jo refuses to forgive Laurie for what she considers a crude joke, but \n        she later relents and goes to the Laurence house under the pretext of \n        returning a book. She finds Mr. Laurence in an angry mood and Laurie shut \n        up in his room. The two have been quarreling over Laurie's silence about \n        the letter affair. Mr. Laurence thinks Laurie is just being impudent. \n        Consequently, Laurie is pondering the idea of running away and refuses \n        to come out of his room until he receives an apology from his grandfather.<PARAGRAPH>Feeling that if she can handle the young one, she can handle the old \n        one, Jo talks Mr. Laurence into writing a formal sounding apology to Laurie.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025235/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Little_Women_Alcott/Little_Women_Study_Guide12.html"}
