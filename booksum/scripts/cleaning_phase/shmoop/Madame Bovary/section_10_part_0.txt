{"name": "Part 2, Chapter 2", "summary": "Emma, Charles, Felicite, and Monsieur Lheureux get out of the Hirondelle for the Bovarys' first glimpse of Yonville. Monsieur Homais is on hand to introduce himself.<PARAGRAPH>Emma checks out the inn. Meanwhile, a blond young man checks her out.<PARAGRAPH>Who is this guy, you may ask? Flaubert tells us. It turns out that this is the Monsieur Leon  mentioned earlier. He's a clerk who works for the notary in town. He, like Emma, is a bored young person trapped in a town full of aging, dull people.<PARAGRAPH>The dinner party, comprised of Emma, Charles, Homais, and Leon, make polite chitter chatter about their trip, and about the town. Homais goes off on a long spiel about Yonville. We realize that his primary mode of communication is probably by long spiel.<PARAGRAPH>Leon and Emma are clearly on the same wavelength - one that nobody else is on. They seem to have similar ideas and interests.<PARAGRAPH>It turns out that Leon is an amateur musician, like Emma. Monsieur Homais, with whom the young clerk lives, claims that Leon is a beautiful singer. Emma is intrigued.<PARAGRAPH>Emma and Leon have a little moment, in which he reveals that he loves German music, \"the kind that makes you dream\"  - what an Emma-like thing to say! He also tells her he's going away to Paris to study to be lawyer.<PARAGRAPH>Homais and Charles have obviously been conversing on their own. Homais attempts to include everyone in the conversation; Emma and Leon aren't interested, and soon get caught up in their private conversation again.<PARAGRAPH>Like Emma, Leon is a big reader, and it seems like they have pretty similar thoughts about literature, as well.<PARAGRAPH>Homais tries to break into their conversation again, offering the use of his personal library to Emma.<PARAGRAPH>Emma and Leon are sitting so close that he has his feet on one of the rungs of her chair.<PARAGRAPH>After dinner, the guests all go their separate ways. Emma and Charles go into their new house for the first time. It doesn't sound too thrilling. We are unsurprised.<PARAGRAPH>Emma philosophically muses that, since her life so far hasn't been too hot, it has to get better.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210422061745/http://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/madame-bovary/summary/part-2-chapter-2"}
