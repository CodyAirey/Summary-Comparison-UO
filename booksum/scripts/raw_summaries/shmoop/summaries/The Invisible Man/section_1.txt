{"name": "Chapter 2", "summary": "Now we're introduced to Teddy Henfrey. He's a villager and a clockjobber, which might sound awesome, but it just means that he fixes clocks. Still awesome, we guess. At any rate, Henfrey makes his way to the Coach and Horses that afternoon.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Hall wants Henfrey to fix a clock in the stranger's room. They enter his room without knocking, which is a bad idea whether your guest is a mad scientist or not. For a moment, Mrs. Hall thinks the stranger has a giant mouth, but he covers his face again.<PARAGRAPH>The stranger tells Mrs. Hall that he would like to be left alone. See, he's an \"experimental investigator\" \u2013 which means scientist \u2013 and he's got some research that could be messed up by people entering whenever they want.<PARAGRAPH>Also, he was in an accident, and his eyes are sensitive, which is why he's always covered and wearing his dark glasses. Wow, sounds like the stranger's got an answer for everything.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Hall leaves Henfrey to fix the clock. Henfrey takes a long time with the clock on purpose, so that he can see more of the stranger. Looks like Henfrey could use a hobby. The stranger catches him wasting time, though, and tells him to finish up and get out.<PARAGRAPH>Henfrey wonders what the man's secret is \u2013 maybe he's wanted by the police? On his way through the village, Henfrey runs into Mr. Hall and tells him, \"You got a rum un up home!\" (2.36). Translation: \"there's a weird guy staying at your place.\"<PARAGRAPH>This gets Mr. Hall a little suspicious. But he's also a little drunk (that's his hobby), so his wife tells him to mind his own business. Although, truth be told, Mrs. Hall is a little suspicious of the stranger herself.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210623094503/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/invisible-man-wells/summary/chapter-2"}
