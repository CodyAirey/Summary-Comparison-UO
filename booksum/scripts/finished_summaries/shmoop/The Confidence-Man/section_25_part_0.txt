According to Judge Hall, backwoodsmen are \"Indian-haters par excellence\" with a complicated history as to why. At one point, James Hall has a mock Q&A with a fictional backwoodsman and another fictional neutral party to assess why such hatred persists. Hall argues that there's a deep-seated distrust among these people. It begins when hatred is passed down through mothers' milk during nursing and is then solidified through community hatred. This is some dark stuff. Ultimately, Hall describes two kinds of backwoodsmen: 1) those who are committed to being loners and 2) those who visit towns and cities on occasion. Committed loners, Hall claims, often \"break\" and find a limited kind of friendship with American Indians. Non-committed loners get their fix of society, so they remain \"Indian-haters par excellence\" their whole lives. The new guy notes that since we only ever meet the non-committed kind of loners, they're our only example of what committed backwoodsmen might be like, thus our evidence is always flawed. Here the cosmopolitan interrupts him: Just a moment please; need to refill my drink.", "analysis": ""}
