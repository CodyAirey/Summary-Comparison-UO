{"name": "Volume I, Chapters IX-XII", "summary": "Summary of Vol. I, Chapter IX<PARAGRAPH>After the ball, Catherine recoils from her disappointment at not being able to dance with Henry. She recovers her spirits in time to make preparations to go to the Pump Room the next morning, where she hopes to run into Henry\u2019s sister Miss Tilney. But just as she is about to set off, John Thorpe arrives at the Allens\u2019 house and reminds Catherine that she promised to go on a carriage ride with him to Claverton Down. Catherine reluctantly goes with John, and Isabella and James follow them in another carriage. John brags about his skill handling horses, and Catherine begins to doubt that he is as agreeable as Isabella made him out to seem. John asks if Mr. Allen is rich. Catherine says that he is, and John insinuates that Catherine might inherit his fortune since the Allens are childless.<PARAGRAPH>John and Catherine go on to banter about college life in Oxford before John reverts to bragging about his skill as a horseman. Catherine begins to find his company extremely tiresome. When they return to the Allens, Isabella expresses her surprise that it is already past three o\u2019clock, which means that she has to return directly home. Catherine is left alone with Mrs. Allen, who reveals that she took a walk with Henry and Miss Tilney that day. Mrs. Allen reveals that Mrs. Tilney, their mother, was a rich woman who died some years ago, leaving her daughter a pearl necklace. Catherine feels \u201cmost particularly unfortunate\u201d at missing a meeting with Henry and his sister.<PARAGRAPH>Summary of Vol. I, Chapter X<PARAGRAPH>Chapter X opens at the theater, where Catherine and Isabella have reconvened only hours after they returned from the carriage ride to Claverton Down. Isabella compliments Catherine profusely on her hairstyle and assures her that John is \u201cquite in love\u201d with her. Isabella then recounts her carriage trip with James and how their \u201copinions were so exactly the same, it was quite ridiculous.\u201d Isabella spends the rest of the evening talking with James, and Catherine begins to feel left out and alienated. She doubts \u201cthe happiness of a situation which confining her entirely to her friend and brother, gave her very little share in the notice of either.\u201d<PARAGRAPH>Luckily, Miss Tilney appears and begins exchanging pleasantries with Catherine. Catherine remarks that Henry dances very well, thus betraying her feelings for him unintentionally. Miss Tilney tells Catherine that they will be at the cotillion ball tomorrow, and Catherine spends that night debating which dress she will wear for the ball.<PARAGRAPH>At the cotillion ball, Isabella dances with James, and Catherine does her best to avoid John. She is pleased when Henry finds her and asks her to dance again. This time she grants his request. John Thorpe interrupts them briefly and complains that Catherine already pledged to be his partner. When he realizes that Henry is Catherine\u2019s partner, he acknowledges that Henry is a \u201cgood figure of a man\u201d and asks Catherine if Henry wants to buy a horse that his friend is selling. John moves away, and Henry complains that he had \u201cno business to withdraw the attention of my partner from me.\u201d Henry turns the conversation to a metaphorical discussion comparing the relationship between dancing partners to a marriage contract. They go on to discuss Bath, and Catherine insists that she finds it much more amusing than her hometown in the country.<PARAGRAPH>Catherine sees Henry\u2019s father General Tilney, a handsome and imposing man across the room, and she is impressed by his appearance. The evening concludes with Miss Tilney inviting Catherine to go on a walk with her and Henry tomorrow morning, provided that it doesn\u2019t rain. Catherine is full of anticipation as the ball concludes.<PARAGRAPH>Summary of Vol. I, Chapter XI<PARAGRAPH>On the morning that she is scheduled to go for a walk in the countryside with the Tilney, Catherine is dismayed to wake up to a cloudy day. It begins to rain as Catherine watches through the window. The walk is scheduled for twelve o\u2019clock, and Catherine waits for the Tilneys until half past twelve. She is summoned to go for a carriage ride with John, Isabella, and James. At first she refuses to go, but John tells her that he just saw Henry and Miss Tilney driving away from Bath in a carriage. Catherine agrees to go with John.<PARAGRAPH>As soon as they head out, Catherine sees Henry and Miss Tilney walking down the street. Catherine implores John to stop the carriage, but he only goes faster. Catherine consoles herself with the prospects of seeing Blaize Castle, a country house, and she imagines that it will meet her expectations of encountering a Gothic castle with \u201cwinding vaults\u201d and a \u201clow, grating door.\u201d However, the traveling party have set out too late to reach their destination, and Catherine feels let down for a second time that day. The rest of the ride is spoiled for Catherine. When she comes home to the Allens, the footman reveals that the Tilneys called for her just minutes after she departed. Isabella makes light of Catherine\u2019s distress that night when they gather at the Thorpes to play cards.<PARAGRAPH>Summary of Vol. I, Chapter XII<PARAGRAPH>Catherine goes to the Tilneys\u2019 house the next day to seek out Miss Tilney and explain why they saw her on the carriage with John, but their servant tells her that Miss Tilney is not at home. As she starts back to the Allens, Catherine spots Miss Tilney exiting her house with her father. Catherine is \u201cdejected and humbled\u201d but manages to enjoy herself at the theater that night until she sees Henry in the opposite box. Henry bows to her stiffly, and Catherine almost rushes over to make amends with him. After the play, Henry visits Catherine\u2019s box, and Catherine explains she was lead to believe that he and his sister had already gone out. Henry accepts her explanation. Catherine is puzzled to see John talking with General Tilney and looking in her direction. John tells Catherine that he was discussing her with General Tilney, and both of the men agreed that Catherine is the \u201cfinest girl in Bath.\u201d Catherine is flattered to be singled out by General Tilney, but she does not enjoy John\u2019s compliment. Nonetheless, she reflects that the evening had done \u201cmore, much more, for her than could have been expected.\u201d", "analysis": "Austen establishes two sets of parallel relationships in Chapters IX and X. The flirtation between Isabella and James intensifies, as made apparent by Isabella\u2019s coy comments to Catherine at the theater. While Isabella insists that she is glad Catherine was not there to tease her and James about their shared opinions during the carriage ride, we may infer that Isabella enjoys testing Catherine\u2019s reactions just as much as she enjoys flirting with her brother. As a younger and more inexperienced woman, Catherine serves as Isabella\u2019s ideal audience in the theater of desire that masquerades as polite society. Although Isabella privileges the notion of privacy here, she is much more concerned with gaining a reputation as a public success, whether it is as the most beautiful girl at the ball or as the object of James\u2019 attention. On his end, James seems just as infatuated with Isabella as she is with him, although he is less concerned with the propriety of his actions\u2014this is why is he unafraid to ask Isabella to dance past the two-dance limit and potentially set off rumors of their growing attachment.<PARAGRAPH>In contrast, Catherine comes to find John\u2019s company suffocating. John\u2019s character is boisterous, loud, and self-aggrandizing, and his obsession with horses makes the carriage ride an exercise in patience for Catherine. Catherine\u2019s thoughts are constantly diverted by the dawning knowledge that John\u2019s vanity leads him to make \u201cidle assertions and impudent falsehoods.\u201d For a girl who has seen so little of the world up until now, this is a rather shocking realization. It is no wonder that Catherine is eager to be distracted by news of the Tilney family. After the carriage ride, Mrs. Allen\u2019s revelation to Catherine that Mrs. Tilney is dead is an instance of foreshadowing: the second part of the novel will deal substantially with Catherine\u2019s quest to determine the cause of Mrs. Tilney\u2019s death.<PARAGRAPH>For now, Catherine\u2019s acquaintance with the Tilney family is still in its first stages. Catherine\u2019s desire to become friends with Miss Tilney mirrors Isabella\u2019s desire to become friends with Catherine, but with a crucial difference. While Isabella wants to use Catherine as a means to reach James, we may infer that Catherine wants to be friends with Miss Tilney for her own sake. Nonetheless, Miss Tilney provides Catherine with crucial information regarding Henry\u2019s plans to attend the cotillion ball.<PARAGRAPH>In Chapter 10, Henry\u2019s extended metaphor comparing a dance to a marriage is an example of his verbal wit. Much like a marriage, Henry says, in a marriage \u201cfidelity and complaisance\u201d are the \u201cprincipal duties\u201d: both men and women must be faithful to the partners they have chosen and not covet the partners of others. However, men have the \u201cadvantage\u201d of choosing their partners in both a dance and a marriage, while women only have the \u201cpower of refusal.\u201d While Catherine dismisses the validity of the comparison, she is struck by the force of Henry\u2019s comparison. Unlike her one-sided conversation with John, Catherine\u2019s exchange with Henry shows us that she is unafraid to speak her mind in the presence of good company.<PARAGRAPH>Catherine\u2019s readerly imagination is ignited by the mention of Blaize Castle during her second carriage ride with John. She invests the image of the castle with the preconceptions she has gained from reading Radcliffe\u2019s Gothic novel: \u201cthe delight of exploring an edifice like Udolpho, as her fancy represented Blaize Castle to be, was such a counterpoise of good, as might console her for almost anything.\u201d However, Catherine\u2019s romantic associations with the unseen house are thwarted when they turn back early, and her desire to indulge in a Gothic fantasy does not truly manifest itself until later in the novel, when she visits the Tilney estate. Thus, the failed carriage ride to Blaize Castle is a preparatory episode that spells out Catherine\u2019s wish to match her reality to the books she has read, namely Radcliffe\u2019s novel.<PARAGRAPH>Isabella\u2019s friendship with Catherine has visibly cooled by the closing scene of Chapter XI. Isabella is insensitive to Catherine\u2019s plight about the Tilneys. Catherine could \u201calmost have accused Isabella of being wanting in tenderness towards herself and her sorrows.\u201d Isabella\u2019s hypocrisy is also apparent to the reader when she berates the Tilneys for failing to appear on time. She tells Catherine that \u201cI never mind going through anything, where a friend is concerned,\u201d but we already know that she is out to serve her own selfish interests.<PARAGRAPH>In Chapter XII, Catherine\u2019s perception that Henry looked angry with her at the theater leads us to believe that he has feelings for her (which explains why he was upset that she had apparently snubbed him while riding in John\u2019s carriage). This is an insight that Catherine does not yet share. Her tone of searching wonder is \u201cthoroughly artless:\u201d unlike Isabella, Catherine does not know how to construct phrases with a double meaning. Her innocence and lack of guile contrasts sharply with Isabella\u2019s coy behavior.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210622234141/https://www.gradesaver.com/northanger-abbey/study-guide/summary-volume-i-chapters-ix-xii"}
