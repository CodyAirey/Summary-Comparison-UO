{"name": "chapter thirteen: fifty-two", "summary": "In the black prison of the Conciergerie, fifty-two prisoners await their doom. Among them is a former general of seventy \nand a young seamstress of twenty. Darnay spends his last evening reconciling himself to his fate and writing letters to \nLucie, Dr. Manette, and Mr. Lorry. He does not think of Carton even once. He goes to bed and dreams of his wonderful \nlife in Soho. In the morning, he paces up and down his cell as the hours tick by and the time of execution draws nearer. \nThe executions are set for three o'clock, and since the tumbrels move slowly through the streets, the prisoners will leave at \ntwo.<PARAGRAPH>At one o'clock Darnay hears footsteps outside. The door opens, and Sydney Carton stands before him with a slight smile. \nHe is the last person Darnay has expected to see. At first he thinks that Carton is a prisoner like himself, but Carton \nquickly assures him that he is not and that he brings a request from Lucie. He does not tell Darnay what the request is. \nCarton then forces Darnay to exchange clothes with him. Suddenly Darnay realizes that Carton is planning to rescue him. \nHe feels that his attempt will put both their lives in peril. Carton instructs Darnay to write a note to Lucie. As the \nprisoner bends over the paper, Carton drugs him and dresses himself in Darnay's clothes. Barsad, with the help of other \nunsuspecting guards, carry the inert body of Darnay out of the prison to the waiting carriage. Carton's plan has succeeded.<PARAGRAPH>At two o'clock the door of Darnay's cell is opened, and he is instructed to \n        follow the jailer. The seamstress, taking him to be Darnay, asks him to \n        hold her hand in the tumbrel. When she looks up at his face, she realizes \n        that he is not Darnay, but does not reveal this to anyone. She is astonished \n        that this noble man is willing to give his life for another man. In the \n        meantime, the carriage containing Dr. Manette, Lucie, little Lucie, Mr. \n        Lorry, and a drugged, sluggish Darnay, makes its way through the barriers \n        and speeds out of Paris.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Dickens/A_Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Study_Guide28.html"}
