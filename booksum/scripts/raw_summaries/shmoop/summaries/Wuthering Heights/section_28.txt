Cathy has been haunting him for eighteen years.<PARAGRAPH>He continues, \"You know I was wild after she died, and eternally, from dawn to dawn, praying her to return to me\u2014her spirit. I have a strong faith in ghosts; I have a conviction that they can, and do exist, among us!\" (29.24).<PARAGRAPH>He tells Nelly that the day after Catherine died, eighteen years ago, he visited her grave and felt her presence there.
