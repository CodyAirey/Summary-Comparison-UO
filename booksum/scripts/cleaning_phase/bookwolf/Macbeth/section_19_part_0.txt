{"name": "Act 5 scene 2", "summary": "Act V - Scene.ii<PARAGRAPH>Summary<PARAGRAPH>At Birnam Wood, close to Macbeth's Castle at Dunsinane, Malcolm and some of the Scottish Lords, plus and English army encamp. They prepare for battle.<PARAGRAPH>The audience now suspects that the play is coming to a climax by the reference to Birnam Wood, which was part of the third apparition seen by Macbeth.<PARAGRAPH>One of the Scottish Lords is Caithness, who paints a picture of Macbeth saying that the royal robe he wears \"hangs loose about him like a giant robe upon a dwarfish thief\". This suggests that Macbeth's title of King, no longer fits him. The dialogue of the Scottish Lords makes it clear to the audience that they have come to cure the sick patient that is Scotland."}
