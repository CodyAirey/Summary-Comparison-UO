{"name": "Chapter 19", "summary": "Linton arrives from London, a \"pale, delicate, effeminate boy\" who greatly resembles Edgar. He is too weak and sick to play with Cathy and has to lie on a couch instead of sitting with the family during tea. Cathy treats him as should would a new pet. Edgar confides in Nelly that he hopes having a playmate his own age will help, if Heathcliff allows Linton to live at the Grange. Edgar's fears are realized when Joseph arrives that evening, demanding to take Linton to Wuthering Heights. Refusing to awaken Linton, Edgar promises Joseph that Linton will be delivered to Heathcliff in the morning.", "analysis": "Although Cathy is excited about the imminent arrival of her \"real\" cousin (she does not want to consider Hareton a relative of hers), she is extremely disappointed in Linton. Cathy and the readers' first impressions are both similar and accurate. Linton's condition will not improve, especially living at Wuthering Heights.\nAs the second-generation characters develop in the second half of Wuthering Heights, readers should note significant similarities and differences between parents and their children. Most noticeably, although Linton's physical condition is nothing like Heathcliff's, he clearly reflects his father's tyrannical personality. Cathy, in turn, seems to possess the wildness of her mother, but her personality is tempered a bit, reflecting the nature of her father. Hareton's features favor his Aunt Catherine, but due to Heathcliff's upbringing, his personality is that of a young Heathcliff.\nGlossary\nsanguine optimistic; hopeful.\ncap and mantle hat and cloak.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201101054152/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/w/wuthering-heights/summary-and-analysis/chapter-19"}
