{"name": "volume 2, Chapter 20", "summary": "Chapter 20: Lieut. Fairfax married Miss Jane Bates, and they had a daughter, Jane Fairfax. The couple soon died however, and Jane was left with her grandmother and aunt. Colonel Campbell, a friend of Jane's father wanted to help, and so he took charge of her education, and he raised her with his family. The Campbells love Jane and want to keep her with them, but what little money they have must go to their own daughter, Miss Campbell, so Jane will soon have to become a governess to support herself. Jane and Miss Campbell are great friends, and Miss Campbell has recently married Mr. Dixon. Emma thinks about why she does not like Jane Fairfax, and wonders if Mr. Knightley is right in thinking it is because Jane is thought of in ways that Emma wishes she herself were thought of. She also thinks that it is because Jane always seems so reserved and indifferent, and because her aunt is such a talker. Emma goes to visit Jane when she arrives, and finds her elegant, and goes on to think that there really was some sort of relationship between her and Mr. Dixon. When Jane and Miss Bates visit Emma at Hartfield, Jane's reserve annoys Emma, as Jane will not answer any of Emma's questions about Frank Churchill, whom she had met at Weymouth", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210421073237/http://www.novelguide.com/emma/summaries/chap19-21"}
