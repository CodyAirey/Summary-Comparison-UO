{"name": "Chapter 16", "summary": "At 1:30, two boatloads of sailors row ashore from the Hispaniola. One of them is humming an Irish marching song, \"Lillibullero\" .<PARAGRAPH>Tom Redruth comes to tell Doctor Livesey that Jim Hawkins has also slipped ashore.<PARAGRAPH>Doctor Livesey is worried for Jim's safety.<PARAGRAPH>Livesey feels restless and decides to use a tiny rowboat to go ashore with Hunter in secret to look for information.<PARAGRAPH>Doctor Livesey finds an abandoned fort at the top of a hill. The best part of the fort is that it has a spring of fresh water. While the ship is well-provisioned and would be easy to defend, there isn't enough water on board for a long battle against the pirates.<PARAGRAPH>Doctor Livesey hears a scream .<PARAGRAPH>Doctor Livesey thinks it's Jim who's been killed.<PARAGRAPH>Livesey and Hunter rush back to the ship.<PARAGRAPH>Squire Trelawney is sitting aboard the Hispaniola thinking that it's Doctor Livesey and Hunter who were killed.<PARAGRAPH>Captain Smollett points out that one of the six sailors left aboard the ship turned pale when he heard the scream.<PARAGRAPH>Captain Smollett thinks that man will join the loyal party.<PARAGRAPH>Doctor Livesey explains his plan to use the abandoned stockade to defend themselves.<PARAGRAPH>They secretly load up the tiny rowboat with ammunition and provisions.<PARAGRAPH>Meanwhile, the Captain and Squire Trelawney stay on deck.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, the charade is over: Squire Trelawney takes out his pistol and tells Israel Hands  to freeze.<PARAGRAPH>The six sailors are totally confused, but since they are surrounded - with Squire Trelawney and Captain Smollett on one end of the ship and Redruth on the other - they obediently go below decks.<PARAGRAPH>During all this activity, Doctor Livesey, Hunter, and Joyce manage to set off for shore in their rowboat filled with provisions.<PARAGRAPH>They unload the rowboat into the fort, then Doctor Livesey and Hunter row back to the Hispaniola. Joyce stays behind to guard the fort, armed with six guns.<PARAGRAPH>Back on the Hispaniola, they load up the rowboat a second time. They dump all of the guns and ammunition they don't have room for over the side of the ship so the pirates can't use them.<PARAGRAPH>The tide is starting to go out, and they hear the sounds of the two boatloads of men coming back from their day on the island.<PARAGRAPH>Doctor Livesey, Squire Trelawney, and Redruth get into the rowboat.<PARAGRAPH>, but he said that Joyce is alone just four paragraphs earlier. Here we see the value of close proofreading!)<PARAGRAPH>They paddle around to the front of the boat where the six sailors are trapped below the deck.<PARAGRAPH>They hear Captain Smollett's voice from the deck of the ship.<PARAGRAPH>Captain Smollett is ordering the sailor they thought might be loyal out of the six - Abraham Gray - to join their party.<PARAGRAPH>They hear the sounds of a fight below the decks, and Abraham Gray bursts out and runs over to Captain Smollett.<PARAGRAPH>Captain Smollett and Abraham Gray drop aboard the tiny rowboat, and they all set off for shore.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210515081630/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/treasure-island-book/summary/chapter-16"}
