{"name": "Volume I, Chapters XIII-XV", "summary": "Summary of Vol. I, Chapter XIII<PARAGRAPH>Isabella, James, and John revive their plans to drive down to Clifton on Sunday and try to convince Catherine to come along. Since Catherine already has plans to go on a walk with the Tilneys, she refuses to be persuaded by her friends. Isabella first appeals to Catherine by flattery, then berates her for \u201chaving more affection\u201d for Miss Tilney. Catherine thinks that Isabella appears \u201cungenerous and selfish,\u201d and she stops linking arms with Isabella.<PARAGRAPH>John sees the Tilneys walking on the street. Without asking Catherine for her permission, he stops them and says that Catherine will be unable to join them for a walk until Tuesday. Catherine is angry and distraught when John announces that he has already made excuses for her. Despite everyone\u2019s protests, she rushes over to the Tilneys\u2019 house and explains that she can still go on their scheduled walk. The Tilneys accept her explanation warmly and introduce her to General Tilney. After a pleasant visit, Catherine goes home to the Allens, where she learns that it is generally considered an act of impropriety for a young lady to drive in an open carriage with a gentleman. She is glad that she refused to go to Clifton with John, Isabella, and James: \u201cfor what would the Tilneys have thought of her, if she had broken her promise to them in order to do what was wrong in itself?\u201d<PARAGRAPH>Summary of Vol. I, Chapter XIV<PARAGRAPH>The Tilneys call for Catherine the next morning, and they walk over to Beechen Cliff, a hill in the countryside. Catherine asks Henry if he ever reads novels, and he reveals that he is also a fan of Anne Radcliffe. Catherine is surprised to hear this because she thought that young men \u201cdespised novels.\u201d Henry asserts that this is not true, and that he has already read \u201chundreds and hundreds\u201d of novels. Catherine and the Tilneys turn to a discussion of history books. While Catherine finds them dull, Miss Tilney is fond of reading them.<PARAGRAPH>As their walk continues, Henry gives Catherine a short lesson on the principles of landscape painting before their talk turns to politics. Catherine has nothing to say on this matter, so she returns the discussion to literature and announces that \u201csomething very shocking\u201d\u2014ie, a new novel\u2014\u201cwill soon come out in London.\u201d Miss Tilney misunderstands Catherine\u2019s phrase to mean that a political disturbance will soon occur. Henry jokingly mocks his sister for her poor understanding. Miss Tilney assures that Catherine that her brother has the highest opinion of women, and Catherine is intrigued by the complexities of Henry\u2019s character.<PARAGRAPH>On the way back to the Allens, Catherine runs into one of Isabella\u2019s younger sisters Anne, who reveals that her other siblings drove down to Clifton that morning along with James. Catherine is pleased that the party decided to go on the outing without her.<PARAGRAPH>Summary of Vol. I, Chapter XV<PARAGRAPH>The day after she drives down to Clifton with James, Isabella sends Catherine a note \u201cspeaking peace and tenderness\u201d and asking her to come visit the Thorpe house. As soon as she arrives, Isabella reveals that she has become engaged to James. Catherine is surprised but pretends that she has already guessed the reason she was summoned to Isabella\u2019s side.<PARAGRAPH>The two girls share delightful thoughts of their future as sisters-in-law, and Isabella even says that Catherine will be \u201cinfinitely dearer\u201d to her than her own sisters. Isabella recounts the night that she met James: she was wearing a yellow gown and immediately found him to be handsome, but she was worried that he was attracted to another young lady named Miss Andrews. Needless to say, Isabella is overjoyed to discover James\u2019 affection matches her own despite her lack of a substantial fortune. Isabella tells Catherine that she would be content to live off a small income.<PARAGRAPH>Meanwhile, James rushes home to the Morelands\u2019 house in Wiltshire to ask for his parents\u2019 approval regarding his marriage. On their end, the Thorpes are excited that their daughter has made a seemingly advantageous match. John approaches Catherine in the drawing room and suggests he would like to court her. Catherine rebuffs him, but he does not get the hint. Instead, he takes her distant behavior as a form of encouragement.", "analysis": "The contrast between Catherine and Isabella\u2019s characters sharpens in Chapter XIII. Whereas Austen portrays Catherine as steadfast in her desire to honor her promise to the Tilneys, Isabella\u2019s character transforms from affectionate and supplicating to accusatory and almost cruel when Catherine refuses to go on the carriage ride. This change in tone is not lost on Catherine, and she wonders at the rapid change in her friend\u2019s behavior.<PARAGRAPH>Catherine\u2019s disillusionment with Isabella takes the form of an unspoken realization that Isabella disregards \u201ceverything but her own gratification,\u201d though the reader has already gleaned this trait of her from her previous speech patterns. Isabella\u2019s diction is prone to hyperbole\u2014for example, she calls Catherine her \u201cdearest\u201d and \u201csweetest\u201d girl in order to persuade her to do what she wants. She also proclaims herself to be one of Catherine\u2019s \u201coldest\u201d friends, though we know that the girls have only known each other for a few weeks. Through her cloying words, Isabella emerges as the foil to Catherine: Austen sets Isabella\u2019s ability to dissemble\u2014ie, to put on false appearances\u2014against Catherine\u2019s intrinsic honesty.<PARAGRAPH>Catherine\u2019s noble determination to remain a loyal friend to the Tilneys pays off in Chapter XIV when she finally gets to go on their long-awaited walk. The debate between Catherine and the Tilneys over the value of reading novels is the most significant episode in this chapter. Though far from an ideal reader, Catherine\u2019s passionate enthusiasm for novels (over and against history books) places her in the position of Austen\u2019s assumed readership, one that overlaps with Anne Radcliffe\u2019s: the same men and women who enjoyed the bestselling Gothic titles of the day may also have perused Northanger Abbey. Austen strives to be a populist author, and this impulse may be inferred by the discussion she injects about reading history books. Catherine and Miss Tilney differ in their opinions of history books. While Miss Tilney defends them, Catherine thinks that they are primarily designed to \u201ctorment\u201d schoolchildren and would rather read a novel. Austen is weighing the relative value of each genre, but she clearly sides with the novelists (rather than the historians). Catherine only reads history now and then as a \u201cduty,\u201d while she derives much more participatory pleasure from reading novels like Radcliffe\u2019s.<PARAGRAPH>Isabella\u2019s engagement to James forms the pivotal event of Chapter XV. Austen has been leading us to expect this event since James and Isabella first danced at the ball, so we do not share Catherine\u2019s surprise at the news that her brother and friend are now engaged. The question of inheritance forms the central concern of the pending marriage between Isabella and James. Though Isabella tells Catherine that she does not care about how much income they will receive from James\u2019 parents, her preoccupation with their financial situation is apparent through her worry that the Morelands will look down on her own small fortune. Given what we know about Isabella\u2019s character, her assertion that she would be happy to live modestly rings false.<PARAGRAPH>In this light, Mrs. Thorpe\u2019s happiness for her favorite daughter is dependent upon the assumption that James is much wealthier than Isabella and will provide her with a handsome income. Similarly, Isabella\u2019s fantasies of married life center around the economic security her fianc\u00e9e will provide her once they are married. Austen dwells on the minutiae of Isabella\u2019s imagined possessions\u2014a \u201ccarriage at her command, a new name on her tickets, and a brilliant exhibition of hoop rings on her finger\u201d\u2014in order to emphasize her vanity. This catalogue demonstrates that Isabella is primarily invested in images of material wealth despite her assertions of spiritual loftiness.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210622234141/https://www.gradesaver.com/northanger-abbey/study-guide/summary-volume-i-chapters-xiii-xv"}
