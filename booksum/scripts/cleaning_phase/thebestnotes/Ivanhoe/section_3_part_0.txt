He then scolds Gurth and Wamba for being \n        late. When Rowena enters to join in the meal, Bois-Guilbert stares at \n        her beauty. In response, she draws a veil over her face. Cedric notices \n        the interchange and is annoyed with the Templar. The chapter ends with \n        the announcement of a stranger at Cedrics gates.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025232/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Ivanhoe_Sir_Walter_Scott/Ivanhoe_Study_Guide08.html"}
