She's also forced to read through lines with everyone.<PARAGRAPH>The behind-the-scenes drama is intense. Henry and Maria rehearse together all the time, mainly their love scenes.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Rushworth is increasingly jealous and, to make matters worse, he's also a terrible actor. Fanny starts trying to help him learn all his lines since she feels sorry for him.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Norris is sewing the costumes and makes Fanny help her.<PARAGRAPH>Fanny is increasingly anxious about the love scene between Edmund and Mary's characters, which has yet to be rehearsed.<PARAGRAPH>The next day Fanny is in her room when Mary comes up to see her.<PARAGRAPH>Mary wants Fanny to read through the love scene with her since she's nervous about reading it with Edmund.<PARAGRAPH>Fanny is horrified but agrees to do it.<PARAGRAPH>Before they start, Mary gossips a bit and sarcastically observes that Maria and Henry should be amazing since they rehearse so much together. She also notes that Sir Thomas wouldn't be so thrilled to see what they've done to his house.<PARAGRAPH>The girls start reading but then Edmund interrupts.<PARAGRAPH>He had the same idea as Mary and wanted Fanny to rehearse with him.<PARAGRAPH>The two then decide to rehearse together with Fanny as their prompter. Fanny would rather be run over by a cart than have to watch this, but she agrees.<PARAGRAPH>Fanny perhaps needs to learn the art of the white lie \u2013 it would get her out of a lot of these situations.
