{"name": "Chapter 42", "summary": "The same night Nancy drugs Sikes and goes to see Rose Maylie, a man and woman are walking towards London along the Great North Road.<PARAGRAPH>The man is tall and lanky, and the woman is sturdy, and carrying a huge bag.<PARAGRAPH>The man keeps urging her to hurry up, even though he\u2019s not carrying anything himself.<PARAGRAPH>It\u2019s our old friends, Noah Claypole and Charlotte, from the Sowerberry\u2019s house.<PARAGRAPH>Charlotte asks Noah how much further it is, and he tells her it\u2019s still plenty far, and to stop resting and hurry up.<PARAGRAPH>Charlotte wants to stop at the first inn or public house they can find, but Noah says that that won\u2019t do\u2014they\u2019ll stop at an out-of-the-way place, and not somewhere on the main road into London, in case they\u2019re pursued.<PARAGRAPH>Charlotte says that if she\u2019s caught and locked up, he will be, too.<PARAGRAPH>He says that she\u2019s the one who took the money.<PARAGRAPH>But she took it for him, she says, and carries it for him because he trusts her.<PARAGRAPH>He doesn\u2019t argue with her\u2014really, though, he made her take it, and carry it, so that if they were caught he\u2019d be able to blame it all on her.<PARAGRAPH>They make their way into London, and don\u2019t stop until they see a very dirty public house called the \"Three Cripples.\"<PARAGRAPH>They go on in, and the only person is a young Jewish man behind the bar.<PARAGRAPH>Noah asks if they can stay there the night, and Barney (our old friend) says he\u2019ll go and ask.<PARAGRAPH>Meanwhile, Noah asks for some dinner and ale, which they\u2019re given in a backroom a few steps down behind the bar.<PARAGRAPH>What Noah doesn\u2019t know is that there\u2019s a small opening behind the bar so that people can spy on the backroom from the bar.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin comes into the bar, and Barney has him listen in on their conversation.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin likes what he hears: they\u2019re discussing the stolen money, of course, and what they plan on doing with it, and how they plan on stealing more.<PARAGRAPH>They say that they\u2019ll need to find a good gang to get on the right track, especially since the money they stole is in a large banknote that they don\u2019t know how to dispose of.<PARAGRAPH>So without further ado, Fagin walks in on their conversation.<PARAGRAPH>He sits at the table next to theirs, and orders a drink.<PARAGRAPH>He makes chitchat with them for a moment about their arrival in the city from the country, and then repeats some of their conversation back to them.<PARAGRAPH>Noah\u2019s alarmed, and ready to blame everything on Charlotte.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin tells him to chill, since he\u2019s in the business (of theft) himself, and can get them in with a \"friend\" who will put them on the right track.<PARAGRAPH>Noah sends Charlotte upstairs with the bundles, and has another word in private with Fagin.<PARAGRAPH>He asks Fagin if his \"friend\" is at the top of his business\u2014of course, Fagin says yes.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin says that he\u2019d have to \"hand over\"\u2014i.e., give up the money he\u2019s already stolen.<PARAGRAPH>Noah\u2019s reluctant to do that, but asks what he\u2019d be paid by Fagin\u2019s \"friend.\"<PARAGRAPH>Fagin replies that the wages include room and board, tobacco, liquor, and half all he and Charlotte both earn.<PARAGRAPH>Of course, Noah realizes that if he says no, Fagin knows enough to have him arrested and hanged, so he says yes. The wages seem pretty good, anyway.<PARAGRAPH>Noah says that Charlotte will be able to work a lot for them both, so he\u2019d like to do something easy, and not too dangerous.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin suggests stealing purses from old ladies, but that\u2019s too dangerous for Noah.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, Fagin suggests stealing from little kids who are sent out on errands.<PARAGRAPH>Noah gives Fagin fake names\u2014Mr. and Mrs. Morris Bolter.<PARAGRAPH>Of course, Charlotte immediately blows their cover by calling him \"Noah\" in front of Fagin.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin doesn\u2019t really care, and tells them good night.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419220659/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/oliver-twist/summary/chapter-42"}
