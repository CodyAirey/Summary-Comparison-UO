{"name": "Chapter Thirty: D\u2019Artagnan and the Englishman", "summary": "D\u2019Artagnan follows Milady out of the church. She gets in her carriage and drives to St. Germain.<PARAGRAPH>He then tracks down Planchet and orders him to fetch two horses from Tr\u00e9ville\u2019s stable and meet him at Athos\u2019s house.<PARAGRAPH>When D\u2019Artagnan arrives, Athos is drinking some Spanish wine.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan tells him about Porthos\u2019s method of getting equipped.<PARAGRAPH>Athos resolves that women with have nothing to do with his equipment.<PARAGRAPH>Planchet arrives; the horses are ready to go.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan explains to Athos where he (D\u2019Artagnan) is going.<PARAGRAPH>Athos assumes that D\u2019Artagnan is in love with the mysterious and beautiful Milady.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan protests that he still loves Madame Bonacieux dearly; the only reason he does not save her is because he does not know where she is.<PARAGRAPH>Athos opens another bottle of wine as D\u2019Artagnan and Planchet head for St. Germain.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan convinces himself that since Milady probably has information regarding Constance, going in search of Milady means possibly saving his true love.<PARAGRAPH>On their way, Planchet and D\u2019Artagnan spy Comte de Wardes\u2019s lackey, Lubin. Figuring that Lubin probably doesn\u2019t remember Planchet, D\u2019Artagnan tells Planchet to go talk to him and find out if the Comte de Wardes is alive or dead.<PARAGRAPH>Planchet strikes up a conversation while D\u2019Artagnan hides behind a hedge.<PARAGRAPH>Milady\u2019s carriage stops in front of the house (where Planchet and Lubin are talking) and she gives orders to her maid. The maid heads over to Planchet and Lubin, but right at that moment Lubin is called back into his own house, leaving Planchet alone on the sidewalk.<PARAGRAPH>Mistaking Planchet for Lubin, the maid walks straight up to Planchet and hands him a note for \"his master.\" Planchet is confused, but, being accustomed to obedience, he runs over to D\u2019Artagnan and gives him the note.<PARAGRAPH>Milady requests a \"walk in the forest\" with the gentleman. The letter was intended for the Comte de Wardes, however, and not for D\u2019Artagnan.<PARAGRAPH>Planchet reports that the Comte de Wardes is still recovering from his earlier sword fight with D\u2019Artagnan.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan congratulates Planchet on a job well done and the two of them jump back on their horses to continue tailing Milady.<PARAGRAPH>They find her in her carriage having a heated exchange with a gentleman on horseback. They are speaking English, but D\u2019Artagnan understands the tone of the conversation well enough. He offers Milady his services in dealing with the man\u2019s lack of respect.<PARAGRAPH>The man is Milady\u2019s brother (the Lord de Winter), and she appears to be fine with the quarrel.<PARAGRAPH>Meanwhile, Milady\u2019s maid is checking out D\u2019Artagnan.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan recognizes the Milady\u2019s interlocutor as the Englishman from Amiens. (He\u2019s the one who won D\u2019Artagnan\u2019s horse in a game of dice.)<PARAGRAPH>They definitely have a reason to fight. The Englishman is going to bring three friends, and D\u2019Artagnan will do likewise.<PARAGRAPH>Of course, our hero will bring Porthos, Aramis, and Athos: his friends are excited for the duel.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210624190147/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/three-musketeers/summary/chapter-thirty-dartagnan-and-the-englishman"}
