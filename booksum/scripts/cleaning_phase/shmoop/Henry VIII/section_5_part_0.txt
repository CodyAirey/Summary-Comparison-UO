{"name": "Act 2, Scene 1", "summary": "Two guys meet on a street, rushing. Why so fast? Guy #2 is on his way to Buckingham's trial, but Guy #1 has just come from there and says it's finished already.<PARAGRAPH>Well, that was fast.<PARAGRAPH>What happened? Guy # 1 explains the trial: Buckingham pled not guilty, but he was found guilty and sentenced to death. It didn't matter that he was eloquent or that he stood up for himself rationally; he was found guilty, anyway.<PARAGRAPH>The gents agree that Wolsey is behind all this. This isn't the first time it's happened, either: Wolsey also kicked Earl Surrey, the Deputy of Ireland, and Kildare out of their positions... and the list goes on.<PARAGRAPH>Wait a minute, says Guy # 1: it seems like Wolsey gets rid of anyone the king likes. Maybe Guy #1 on to something...<PARAGRAPH>As the men are talking, Buckingham enters with Lovell, Vaux, Sands, and a bunch of commoners. Buckingham delivers a heartfelt speech about how he's been wrongly accused. But he's not calling for revenge; instead, he forgives the men who did this to him. Now he's off to heaven.<PARAGRAPH>There's not a dry eye in the house. Lovell asks for forgiveness, and Buckingham grants it--in fact, he forgives everyone.<PARAGRAPH>Vaux orders for a barge to be prepared to take them away. Oh, and it should be made nice enough for a duke, since Buckingham is a duke and all.<PARAGRAPH>Buckingham jumps in and stops Vaux: he might have come in as a duke, but he leaves as plain old Edward Bohun. He thinks back to his father's role in English history, and he thinks about the past few kings who ruled.<PARAGRAPH>Buckingham recognizes that he's repeated history in some ways: his dad thought his buddies were loyal to him, but they killed him. Now something similar is happening to Buckingham himself. At least he got a trial?<PARAGRAPH>Too bad it wasn't much of a trial.<PARAGRAPH>Buckingham warns everyone to be careful whom you trust, since not everyone is loyal.<PARAGRAPH>Then Buckingham's off.<PARAGRAPH>The gents think this is sad: a guiltless man taken away to execution is neither fair nor just. The gents pray that the angels keep them from wicked men who play in evil trickery and deceitful trials.<PARAGRAPH>Then Guy #2 asks Guys #1 if he's heard the latest rumor around the water cooler: Henry is splitting up with Katherine.<PARAGRAPH>The gents agree that this must all be Wolsey's doing. Katherine doesn't obey Wolsey blindly, and she's suspicious of him. On top of that, Katherine's dad  didn't hire Wolsey for a job that one time. No wonder Wolsey's orchestrated the break-up.<PARAGRAPH>This isn't an ordinary rumor, though: Cardinal Campeius from Rome has arrived to talk to Henry about it. Married people can't just go and break up , so this is a really big deal. The gents think this means the rumor is true.<PARAGRAPH>Then the gents look around. They're out in the open, and they've been talking about a private matter. They don't want to get in trouble, so they hightail it right out of there.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20211204103637/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/henry-viii/summary/act-2-scene-1"}
