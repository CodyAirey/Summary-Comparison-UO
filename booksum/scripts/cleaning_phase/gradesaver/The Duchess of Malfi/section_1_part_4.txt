Julia worries about the Cardinal's constancy, but he dismisses her concern as evidence of her own guilt over her infidelity. A servant enters to tell Julia that someone carrying post from Malfi desires to see her. PARAGRAPH>Delio, one of her former suitors, enters, and offers Julia money as a favor. Another servant enters to tell Julia that her husband is in Rome and has delivered a letter to Ferdinand that has left him in a foul mood. After the servant leaves, Delio asks Julia to be his mistress. She says she will ask her husband--he doesn't know if she's joking or not--and leaves. Delio fears Castruccio's delivery of bad news to Ferdinand means that Antonio and the Duchess have been found out", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210410192112/https://www.gradesaver.com/the-duchess-of-malfi/study-guide/summary-act-2"}
