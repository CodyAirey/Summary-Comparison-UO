Doesn't seem too bright.<PARAGRAPH>Alek finishes closing the viewport, just as the walker is struck by shrapnel.<PARAGRAPH>As the dreadnaught continues its pursuit, Klopp and Volger argue about whether or not a smaller walker would have been a better choice. Maybe save it for later, guys?<PARAGRAPH>In the process, Volger and Klopp reveal that they're headed for Switzerland. Probs for the watches and chocolate--oh right, or the neutrality. Take your pick.<PARAGRAPH>Bauer and Hoffman are firing at the dreadnaught, which Alek says won't do any good because it's so big. Klopp helpfully reminds him that the dreadnaught will have smaller escorts.<PARAGRAPH>The attack leaves Alek in no doubt that his mother and father are dead; he feels empty for a moment, until another attack from the dreadnaught's guns distracts him.<PARAGRAPH>Bauer and Hoffman fire the walker's cannon at the dreadnaught, and Volger asks Alek if he knows how to use a Spandau machine gun.<PARAGRAPH>He doesn't, but he's going to give it a shot anyway.
