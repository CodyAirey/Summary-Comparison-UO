There is a fresh air about Dunsinane again; similar to that when King Duncan first arrived.<PARAGRAPH>Interpretation<PARAGRAPH>When Macbeth fights Siward's son, there would be a doubt in his mind whether he would prevail. Before they actually fight, there is a combat of words during which young Siward taunts Macbeth calling him a liar and a devil. After Macbeth has killed young Siward, he mocks the body by saying \"Thou wast born of woman\".<PARAGRAPH>Just then, Macduff enters determined to gain revenge for the loss of his family and with the hope that he will assuage his guilt.

Macbeth was a victim of his own poison.<PARAGRAPH>Malcolm is to be crowned King of Scots at Scone.<PARAGRAPH>Malcolm closes the play with the words \"Of this dead butcher, and his fiend like Queen, who by self and violent hands took off her life.
