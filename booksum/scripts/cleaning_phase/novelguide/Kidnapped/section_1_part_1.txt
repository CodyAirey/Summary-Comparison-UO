{"name": "Chapter I", "summary": "Chapter I. The sixteen-year-old narrator, David Balfour, begins his story one morning in June 1751 as he is leaving his family home in Essendean, in the Lowlands of Scotland to seek his fortune. His father has recently died and his mother has been dead for some time. Mr. Campbell, the preacher who has looked after David since his father's death, meets him at the garden gate. Mr. Campbell reveals that before David's father died, he gave him a letter for David detailing David's inheritance. Mr. Campbell adds that David's father wanted his son to go to the house of Shaws, near Edinburgh, which is where David's father came from. Mr. Campbell explains that the house of Shaws belongs to the Balfour family, and that David is a relative of theirs. Mr. Campbell gives David the letter, which is addressed to Ebenezer Balfour of Shaws. Mr. Campbell encourages David to go to the house of Shaws, as the worst that can happen is that David's relatives turn him away and he has to make the two-day journey back. Before David departs, Mr. Campbell gives him four things: the small sum of money left to him from his father's estate, a shilling from Mr. Campbell and his wife, a Bible, and a recipe for a healing water made from lilies of the valley", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210511071637/https://www.novelguide.com/kidnapped/summaries/chapter1-6"}
