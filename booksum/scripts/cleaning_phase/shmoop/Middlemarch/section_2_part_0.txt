{"name": "Book 1, Chapter 3", "summary": "By the next day, Dorothea's already decided that Mr. Casaubon's the man for her, moles and all.<PARAGRAPH>She feels that she'll be able to learn from him. Dorothea has a sense that there's a whole world of knowledge out there that she hasn't been able to access, and she thinks that Mr. Casaubon will give her the key to the world's knowledge.<PARAGRAPH>She's pretty sure that he's considering the idea of proposing to her, and she's grateful to him for even thinking of it - she feels so unworthy next to his great knowledge and vast wisdom.<PARAGRAPH>Dorothea's wandering around, thinking of how great Mr. Casaubon is, when Sir James Chettam shows up on horseback.<PARAGRAPH>Dorothea still thinks he's interested in Celia , and is irritable with him for interrupting her thoughts.<PARAGRAPH>When he asks to see her plan for improving the cottages of the tenants in the village, she warms up to him.<PARAGRAPH>Celia knows that Sir James is interested in Dorothea, and feels sorry for him - she knows Dorothea will reject him.<PARAGRAPH>Several days later, Mr. Casaubon comes for another visit.<PARAGRAPH>Dorothea finds new reasons to like him: she loves that he doesn't engage in small talk or idle chitchat like everyone else. He only talks about important subjects, or else keeps his mouth shut.<PARAGRAPH>Unfortunately, he doesn't seem to care about building better cottages for the villagers . He's more interested in the houses the ancient Egyptians lived in.<PARAGRAPH>Sir James visits more often than Mr. Casaubon, and he's so interested in Dorothea's cottage plans that she begins almost to like him - of course, she only likes him as a future brother-in-law. She still doesn't realize that he's there to court her, and not Celia.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210307064824/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/middlemarch/summary/book-1-chapter-3"}
