{"name": "Act 3, Scene 1", "summary": "On a street in Rome, Coriolanus, Cominius, and Titus Lartius have a little chit-chat about Tullus Aufidius.<PARAGRAPH>Apparently, Aufidius has slapped together a new Volscian army that is ready to rumble with Rome again.<PARAGRAPH>Oh, this can't be good.<PARAGRAPH>Now Sicinius and Brutus show up with more bad news: the plebeians have changed their minds and no longer want Coriolanus to be elected consul. They're all \"Gee. Tough break, Coriolanus.\"<PARAGRAPH>Coriolanus is seriously ticked off when he hears the news. He accuses the tribunes of turning the people against him. <PARAGRAPH>Naturally, Sicinius and Brutus act all innocent and go through a big \"Who, us?\" routine.<PARAGRAPH>Then Coriolanus does exactly what the tribunes were hoping he would do. He flips out and turns into a giant rage-a-holic who says all the wrong things.<PARAGRAPH>He bashes the plebeians and goes off about how much he hates them and why he thinks the \"rabble\" shouldn't have any say in how a government is run.<PARAGRAPH>Coriolanus then threatens to take away the plebeians' right to elect tribunes.<PARAGRAPH>Big mistake. Sicinius and Brutus accuse Coriolanus of treason and demand that he be arrested ASAP.<PARAGRAPH><PARAGRAPH>By this time, the mob of plebeians has rushed back onto the scene to demand Coriolanus' death.<PARAGRAPH>Fortunately for Coriolanus, the Senators help him escape the angry mob.<PARAGRAPH>Sicinius tells the mob that Coriolanus is a \"disease that must be cut away.\" <PARAGRAPH>Menenius finally stops the rioting when he tells the mob that he'll try to talk some sense into Coriolanus and promises to bring him to the marketplace for a public meeting.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200921130811/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/coriolanus/summary/act-3-scene-1"}
