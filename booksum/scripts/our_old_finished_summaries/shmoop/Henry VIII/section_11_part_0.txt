This time, they're waiting to see Anne pass by. It's her coronation day , and they can't wait to see their new queen. This is way better than the last time they met , and they're glad to meet on a happier occasion. Guy #1 reminds the other guy that Anne isn't the only one with a new title today. Suffolk is becoming High Steward, and Norfolk is becoming Earl Marshall. At this point, Guy #2 brings up the fact that Katherine has become Princess Dowager. What's become of her, anyway? Guy # 1 reports that since the divorce, she's been taken off to Kimbolton, and she's sick. Trumpets sound, and choristers sing. There's a flourish as Anne makes her way, and the gents are impressed: she looks like an angel. After the gents figure out who each noble is, a third gent joins them. He's just seen the ceremony and wants to tell them all about it. Everyone crowded around the abbey to watch, and Anne was totally hot. Guy #3 says he's never seen so much joy before. Cranmer performed the ceremony, and the choir sang. Then Guy #3 comments that Gardiner was there, and there's no love lost between him and Cranmer. Oh, well: Cranmer's got Cromwell by his side, and that guy is super loyal. Nothing will come of Cranmer's feud with Gardiner, then. The guy's sure of it.", "analysis": ""}
