He also thinks that Bertram should marry Lafew's daughter.  Bertram enters and gives Lafew the ring on his finger for his daughter.  Lafew recognizes the ring as the one Helena wore when she was at court.  Bertram denies that the ring was Helena's even though the King said he gave it to her.  Bertram says that he got the ring from a woman in Florence  The King comes to the conclusion that since Bertram hated Helena he had her killed.

The King brings Bertram back, and Diana and her mother enter.  They claim that Diana should be Bertram's wife, but he refuses.
