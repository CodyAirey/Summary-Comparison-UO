Observing Richard, Weevle says to Guppy that Richard's is a case of \"smouldering\" (rather than \"spontaneous\") combustion.\nIt occurs to Guppy that Captain Hawdon's papers may have survived the incineration of Krook. Grandfather Smallweed (in the company of Judy and Tulkinghorn, who is acting as Smallweed's solicitor) is already at Krook's place, searching through a litter of papers. No one finds anything of any value.", "analysis": "By standing up to the vile but powerful Tulkinghorn, Guppy slightly redeems himself from the absurdity which he epitomized in the preceding chapter. Grandfather Smallweed's greed and Tulkinghorn's obsession remain prominent.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201101003913/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/b/bleak-house/summary-and-analysis/chapter-39"}
