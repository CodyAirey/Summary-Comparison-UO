{"name": "Chapter XXIV", "summary": "Chapter XXIV: Why the Princes of Italy Have Lost Their States  Machiavelli suggests that any new prince who successfully follows the advice found in The Prince will enjoy the stability of a hereditary prince, since men are more aware of the present than of the past.

These princes failed because of their own incompetence and not as a result of a string of bad luck. They took too much comfort in prosperous times, never anticipating danger.
