{"name": "volume 3, Chapter 17", "summary": "Chapter 17:<PARAGRAPH>Frankenstein resumes his narration at the start of this chapter. Bewildered by the creature's story and enraged by his account of William's death, Victor initially refuses to create a female companion for him. He argues that their \"joint wickedness\" would be enough to destroy the world. The creature replies by saying that he is only malicious as a result of his misery: why should he meet man's contempt with submission. If he is met with hatred, he can only respond in kind. He appeals to Victor for sympathy, and asks Frankenstein to provide him with a lover to share in his suffering. If he complies, the creature promises to quit the company of mankind forever. PARAGRAPH>Frankenstein cannot help but see the justness of this argument. Though he feels a certain compassion for the creature, the \"loathsomeness\" of his appearance soon replaces his sympathy with horror and hatred. The creature continues to plead, saying that his \"vices are the children of a forced solitude\"; in the company of another his virtues would come forth, and he would thus become \"linked to the chain of existence and events\" from which he is now excluded. PARAGRAPH>Victor is torn. He thinks of the creature's supernatural strength, and about the great destruction he still might cause. He therefore determines to comply with the creature's request, in order to save both his family and the rest of humanity. The creature says that he will anxiously observe his progress and then leaves him. Victor descends the mountain with a heavy heart, and returns to Geneva haggard. PARAGRAPH>Analysis:<PARAGRAPH>The most important feature of this chapter is the way in which the creature convinces Frankenstein to comply with his request. Throughout the better part of their exchange, the creature's tone is reasonable in the extreme: in fact, his desire for a companion seems almost noble. In this way, he will divest himself of his longing for violence and revenge, and lead a blameless life. PARAGRAPH>By aligning his maliciousness with his misery, he is implicitly blaming Frankenstein for what he has become: such an accusation, however, is effective in evoking the sympathy of both Victor and the reader. The creature often refers to Frankenstein as \"you, my creator\": this doubled form of address does not only serve to remind Victor of the responsibility he bears for giving the creature life; it is also a complimentary title that implores him for help. PARAGRAPH>As he speaks, the creature's syntax becomes almost Biblical in tone: he frequently uses the verb \"shall,\" which has the ring of both prophecy and command. He is thus subtly informing Victor that he has no choice in this matter: his acquiescence is already a foregone conclusion", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210420003408/https://www.gradesaver.com/frankenstein/study-guide/summary-chapters-17-20"}
