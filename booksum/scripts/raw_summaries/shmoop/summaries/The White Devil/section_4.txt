{"name": "Act 3, Scene 1", "summary": "Francisco, Monticelso, and others enter (the Chancellor and Register\u2014but they don't say anything).<PARAGRAPH>Francisco compliments Monticelso on getting the important ambassadors of other countries to see Vittoria's trial. Monticelso says it will help make Vittoria infamous, and wonders if Brachiano will be there. Francisco says that would be too impudent. They exit.<PARAGRAPH>Flamineo and Marcello enter with a lawyer.  Flamineo and the lawyer joke about how only whore-masters (pimps) would be qualified to judge Vittoria.<PARAGRAPH>They discuss how the cardinal can discredit Vittoria if he only proves that she kissed the Duke\u2014since that indicates Brachiano probably was able to round the other bases (so to speak).<PARAGRAPH>Flamineo says, in an aside, that he's only acting mirthful to quiet suspicion.<PARAGRAPH>Marcello accuses Flamineo of being Brachiano's henchman. Flamineo says he's only trying to help himself and Vittoria to make their way in the world. He says that Marcello's method, of remaining totally loyal on Francisco with no concern for his own advancement, doesn't seem to lead anywhere\u2014he's still poor.<PARAGRAPH>Marcello says being obsessed with advancement poisons you morally. It's better to be virtuous and honest. Flamineo says he'll think about it.<PARAGRAPH>The ambassadors enter. Flamineo and the lawyer make sexual jokes about the French ambassador and mock the Spanish ambassador's appearance.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210613134721/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/the-white-devil/summary/act-3-scene-1"}
