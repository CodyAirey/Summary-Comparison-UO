{"name": "Chapter 5", "summary": "David's crying in the cart as they drive away when, suddenly, Peggotty jumps through the hedge next to the road and climbs onto the cart.<PARAGRAPH>She hugs David tightly, presses a purse into his hand, and then runs away.<PARAGRAPH>The carrier, Mr. Barkis, starts his driving again.<PARAGRAPH>The purse holds a bit of money and note: \"For Davy. With my love\" (5.4). Seeing this, David starts weeping yet again.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Barkis tells David that they will only be going as far as Yarmouth, where David will catch a coach to his final destination.<PARAGRAPH>Then, David offers Mr. Barkis a piece of cake.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Barkis eats it and asks if it was made by Peggotty.<PARAGRAPH>David answers yes, Peggotty does all of their cooking.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Barkis asks if Peggotty has any sweethearts \u2013 suitors.<PARAGRAPH>David says, no, so far as he knows, Peggotty has never had a boyfriend.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Barkis wonders if David will be writing letters to Peggotty. David says, yes, of course.<PARAGRAPH>The carrier asks David to include a message in his next letter to Peggotty: \"Barkis is willin'\" (5.35).<PARAGRAPH>But Mr. Barkis won't clarify what, exactly, he's willing to do.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Barkis and David arrive at a totally unfamiliar (to David) inn at Yarmouth.<PARAGRAPH>David introduces himself as Copperfield, then as Murdstone, to the lady at the inn, who agrees that a dinner has been bought for him.<PARAGRAPH>He settles in for dinner with a waiter who, while seeming like a nice guy, still manages to steal David's food, ale, and dessert right out from under his nose.<PARAGRAPH>Then, the waiter brings David ink and paper, which he plans to use to write to Peggotty.<PARAGRAPH>The waiter scares David half to death with stories of boys being beaten at school \u2013 boys of exactly David's age, between eight and nine.<PARAGRAPH>The waiter also manages to guilt David into giving him a giant tip.<PARAGRAPH>David gets into a public coach bound for London.<PARAGRAPH>Having supposedly eaten so very much (when it was really the rascally waiter), David feels annoyed that he's now the butt of a lot of jokes between the coachman and the other passengers about his appetite.<PARAGRAPH>The coach carries David to an inn in the Whitechapel district, where he is left behind.<PARAGRAPH>Nobody there is expecting a boy called Copperfield, from Blunderstone, Suffolk.<PARAGRAPH>David feels incredibly isolated: what if no one comes to pick him up? What will he do?<PARAGRAPH>Finally, someone comes to the inn office: a thin young man with lots of stubble and a poor suit of clothes. This guy is one of the teachers at Salem House, David's new school, and he has come to fetch David.<PARAGRAPH>David and this teacher agree to stop on the way to the school so that David can get something to eat.<PARAGRAPH>They pause at a housing complex for poor women; they enter a small apartment where an elderly woman greets the teacher as, \"My Charley!\" (5.114). (We find out later that his name is Mr. Mell.)<PARAGRAPH>The apartment is terribly cold and poor and meager, but the elderly woman still has enough to cook up some breakfast for David.<PARAGRAPH>The woman asks Mr. Mell \u2013 whom David calls \"the Master,\" because he is a master, a.k.a. a teacher, at Salem House \u2013 to play the flute a bit.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Mell does, but the music is awful \u2013 his music is terribly sad and dismal.<PARAGRAPH>Eventually, a friend comes by, another elderly lady: Mrs. Fibbitson.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Fibbitson agrees with his mother that Mr. Mell plays the flute beautifully \u2013 which is totally not true, but does spare his mother's feelings.<PARAGRAPH>David soon nods off to sleep to the sound of this awful flute.<PARAGRAPH>He sleeps right through the subsequent coach ride to his new home, Salem House.<PARAGRAPH>This school is incredibly grim looking.<PARAGRAPH>The door of the school is opened by a man with a wooden leg (who, we later learn, is named Tungay), who tells Mr. Mell that the cobbler (read: a shoemaker) has been by the house, but hasn't been able to fix his boots.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Mell is clearly really bummed.<PARAGRAPH>David notices that Mr. Mell's shoes and socks both have holes in them.<PARAGRAPH>David also learns that he's there during the school's holiday season, so there are no other boys on campus.<PARAGRAPH>Even the owner of the school, Mr. Creakle, and his family aren't there.<PARAGRAPH>David goes into an empty schoolroom, where he finds a little sign that says, \"Take care of him. He bites\" (5.136).<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Mell comes up behind David and asks what he's doing.<PARAGRAPH>David asks if there is a dog around that he should be careful of.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Mell says the sign's not for a dog, it's for David: they have been warned that he bites.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Mell apologizes for having to start out with David in this way, but he has to put the sign around David's neck.<PARAGRAPH>This sign does terrible things for David's confidence: he becomes paranoid that people think he really does bite.<PARAGRAPH>As David explores the school in everyone's absence, he sees that a lot of the boys have carved their names in an old door to the playground; he tries to figure out what kind of people they are from the way they carve their names.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Mell and David both have long lists of chores to do, but David gets through them because he has nothing else to do.<PARAGRAPH>David also spends a lot of time with Tungay, who acts as a kind of caretaker to the building. He's pretty mean to David; he won't let him turn his sign so that no one can see it.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Mell is never cruel to David, though he doesn't talk to him much. David thinks Mr. Mell likes having company.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200929182814/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/david-copperfield/summary/chapter-5"}
