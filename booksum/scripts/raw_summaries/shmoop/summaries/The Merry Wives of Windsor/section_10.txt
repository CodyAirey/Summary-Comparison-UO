{"name": "Act 3, Scene 4", "summary": "Outside Master Page's house, Anne and dreamy Fenton get cozy and talk about their future together.<PARAGRAPH>Fenton is bummed out that Anne's dad hates him and won't let him marry his daughter.<PARAGRAPH>Fenton tells Anne that her dad doesn't like him because he thinks he's a spoiled brat who wasted all his money and wants to marry Anne because she's rich. Plus, Master Page isn't crazy about Fenton's misspent youth.<PARAGRAPH>Hmm, Master Page might have a point.<PARAGRAPH>Fenton confesses that, yeah, at first, he only wanted Anne for her dough but now that he's gotten to know her, he's fallen in love.<PARAGRAPH>Fenton swears up and down that he loves Anne for herself and thinks she's worth much more than a giant bag of \"gold.\"<PARAGRAPH>Anne encourages Fenton to take another crack at her dad. Who knows? Maybe Master Page will change his mind. (Yeah, right.)<PARAGRAPH>Just then, Slender, Shallow, and Mistress Quickly show up: Slender wants to talk to Anne.<PARAGRAPH>We find out that Master Page wants Anne to marry Slender because Slender's loaded.<PARAGRAPH>Mistress Quickly distracts Fenton as Slender tries to flirt with Anne.<PARAGRAPH>Slender has zero game with the ladies, so Shallow tries to help him out. He says Anne will be living large if she marries Slender.<PARAGRAPH>Plus, if he dies, she gets a big widow's pension.<PARAGRAPH>Anne is not impressed. She warns Shallow that he should let Slender \"woo for himself.\"<PARAGRAPH>Fed up, Anne confronts Slender and asks him what he wants from her.<PARAGRAPH>Slender says \"I would little or nothing with you\" (translation: he doesn't actually want anything from her), and points out that Anne's dad and his uncle are the ones who want him to marry her.<PARAGRAPH>See? We told you Slender's got no game.<PARAGRAPH>Master and Mistress Page show up and get mad when they see Fenton.<PARAGRAPH>Master Page tells Fenton to scram and says he'll never let Anne marry him.<PARAGRAPH>When Master Page leaves, Mistress Quickly tells Fenton to talk to Anne's mom.<PARAGRAPH>He does, telling her how much he loves her daughter, and Anne pipes in with \"Please don't marry me off to a fool.\" (That would be Slender).<PARAGRAPH>Mistress Page says she won't. She has her eye on Doctor Caius.<PARAGRAPH>Anne says she'd rather be buried alive than marry that guy.<PARAGRAPH>Mistress Page orders Fenton to go home and takes Anne inside the house, promising to ask who she does want to marry.<PARAGRAPH>Mistress Quickly gives us a little aside that she likes Fenton the best, but she's still going to help out all of Anne's suitors.<PARAGRAPH>Because why? Oh, why not. She's probably getting money and trinkets from them all.<PARAGRAPH>Then Mistress Quickly runs off to relay a message to Falstaff from Mistress Ford and Mistress Page.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20211017012900/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/merry-wives-of-windsor/summary/act-3-scene-4"}
