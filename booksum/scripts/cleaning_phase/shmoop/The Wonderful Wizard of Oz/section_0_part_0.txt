{"name": "Chapter 1", "summary": "Meet Dorothy, an all-American gal who lives with her Uncle Henry and Aunt Em in Middle-of-Nowhere, Kansas. They live on a rickety farm that sounds like it would get terrible reviews on Airbnb.<PARAGRAPH>Farm tour: it won't take long, because there's only one room. Well, two, if you count the cyclone cellar, which we have a feeling is about to be put to good use.<PARAGRAPH>Prairie tour: literally everything is gray, including the land, the farm, Aunt Em, and Uncle Henry. Kansas sounds like a total bummer so far.<PARAGRAPH>Oh, here's Toto! He is Dorothy's dog, and he's clearly the life of this party. His interests include playing and more playing.<PARAGRAPH>Uncle Henry looks up at the sky and realizes a big storm's a-coming.<PARAGRAPH>The cyclone comes on fast. Everyone's flying down into the cyclone cellar except for Toto, the idiot, who's under the bed.<PARAGRAPH>Before Dorothy and Toto make it into the cellar, the house itself gets swept up into the cyclone. Looks like Dorothy's about to go on an unexpected vacation.<PARAGRAPH>The house is in the center of the cyclone. Dorothy's pretty chill about it, all things considered, but Toto is freaking out--so much so that he almost flies out of the trapdoor. Dorothy saves him, though.<PARAGRAPH>They've been in the cyclone so long now that Dorothy decides to go to bed. Night, Dorothy.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210617042157/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/wonderful-wizard-of-oz-book/summary/chapter-1"}
