At one point, he is unexpectedly approached by a woman, who invites him for coffee \nand asks him to help her with her ideological problems. At her home, he is shocked by her wealthy lifestyle and wonders \nif she is not trying to buy off some of her guilty conscience with Brotherhood donations. However, she is consciously and \novertly feminine in her behavior and appears very interested in learning about the Brotherhood. She serves wine and \nexplains that she wants to adopt a new philosophy in order to replace the emptiness in her life. She tells him that although \nhe makes one feel very secure with his ideology, he also makes her feel afraid. He is shocked by her word choice until \nshe clarifies that she thinks he is very forceful and powerful. He explains that the power is in the organization. She tells \nhim that she feels compelled to respond to his speech whether or not she understands his meaning.<PARAGRAPH>The narrator becomes aware of their physical closeness and hesitates, but she urges him to continue to speak. When a bell \nrings, he gets up to leave, but she asks him to stay. She explains it is only the phone and that her husband is in Chicago. \nShe begins touching his biceps as she speaks to him.
