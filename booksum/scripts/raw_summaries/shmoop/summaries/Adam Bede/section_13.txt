{"name": "Chapter 14", "summary": "Now back to the Bedes. Adam and Lisbeth are standing at the door to their cottage, watching Seth and Dinah depart. Lisbeth declares herself \"loathe to see the last\" of Dinah (14.2). But Adam is convinced that Seth will eventually win Dinah over and bring her back. Lisbeth is pretty skeptical about this ever happening.<PARAGRAPH>Seth and Dinah, meanwhile, have approached the Hall Farm. And whom should they meet but our friend Hetty. Seth soon turns homeward, and Dinah and Hetty walk on together. As Dinah explains, Seth is \"very full of trouble tonight\" (14.9). Or does he just not like girl talk?<PARAGRAPH>Dinah notices that Hetty seems troubled, and tries to reassure her by talking about the Bede Brothers. Wouldn't Adam make Hetty a nice husband? The upshot of Hetty's response (in all seriousness): um, yeah, no.<PARAGRAPH>Soon the girls are at the Hall Farm and can see the big, burly figure of Martin Poyser standing in the doorway. He's an easygoing fellow, but Mrs. Poyser is upset that the girls are home so late: \"Look at the clock, do; why, it's going on for half-past nine\" (14.24). Not quite three in the morning, but this is a much simpler era, people.<PARAGRAPH>The family now assembles for a one of those Norman Rockwell-esque \"happy family\" scenes. Hetty fusses with Totty a bit, but everyone else is at peace. Then (at like what, nine forty-five?) it's time for bed. Goodnight, everyone.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210630082925/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/adam-bede/summary/chapter-14"}
