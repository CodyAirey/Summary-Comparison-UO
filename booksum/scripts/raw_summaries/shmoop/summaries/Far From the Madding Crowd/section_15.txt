{"name": "Chapter 16", "summary": "Cut to a scene inside a church. A young man in a military jacket talks to a priest and goes up to the altar as if he's getting ready to be married. The only problem is that there doesn't seem to be a bride anywhere around.<PARAGRAPH>Eventually, the priest leaves. Finally, the young man turns and looks around the church. Not seeing anyone he knows, he walks out of the church and meets a young woman in a park.<PARAGRAPH>She says she got the church mixed up (uhhh\u2026 way to go, lady) and that she hopes they can be married the next day just as easily. The dude is mad, though, and he says that he won't be ready to make another go at it for some time.<PARAGRAPH>The woman (probably Fanny) ends the chapter by asking when the (next) wedding will be. The guy just says, \"God knows!\" and walks away from her.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219162644/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/far-from-the-madding-crowd/summary/chapter-16"}
