18. FIDDLE MORD'S DEATH

Now it must be told how Fiddle Mord took a sickness and breathed
his last; and that was thought great scathe.  His daughter Unna
took all the goods he left behind him.  She was then still
unmarried the second time.  She was very layish, and unthrifty of
her property; so that her goods and ready money wasted away, and
at last she had scarce anything left but land and stock.
