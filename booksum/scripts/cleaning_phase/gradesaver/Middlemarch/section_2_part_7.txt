{"name": "book 3, Chapter 29", "summary": "PARAGRAPH>Chapter 29:<PARAGRAPH>Summary:<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Casaubon's beliefs about marriage are reiterated; he wanted to marry someone young and impressionable, so that she would be pleasant and able to help him with his work and be taught by him. He also believed that marriage would make him happy for the first time; but marriage could never instantly change his disposition, and his hopes for his union were too high, as were Dorothea's. Casaubon and Dorothea have a bit of a tiff, as Casaubon tells her that he does not want Ladislaw to visit, and Dorothea resents the condescending and mean-natured tone he takes with her. Casaubon is weakened, and Dorothea strengthened by this altercation; it seems like this relationship is going to make her stronger, though it will definitely not work out. PARAGRAPH>Analysis:<PARAGRAPH>Here, Eliot foreshadows the outcome of Casaubon and Dorothea's relationship; though, with every clash Casaubon feels weaker and more vulnerable, Dorothea only learns how to defend herself and becomes more confident. The tables have just turned, and it is unlikely that their relationship will be able to last any significant amount of time. Casaubon's dearest fantasy, about marriage bringing him perfect contentment and filling the gaps in his life, is falling apart, and he is faltering along with it. PARAGRAPH>Sir James' misgivings about Dorothea's union prove true; the question is, will the problems in her union resolve themselves, or will she just be trapped. Dorothea does not deserve to pay such a penance for anything she is done; it comes down to whether fate is kind to her or not as to what happens, and how her story ends", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210125120143/https://www.gradesaver.com/middlemarch/study-guide/summary-chapters-23-33"}
