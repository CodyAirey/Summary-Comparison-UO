{"name": "Chapter 18", "summary": "One night, John wakes Beauty up in the middle of the night and saddles him up as fast as he can. Squire Gordon tells John to ride for his life--\"that is, for your mistress's life\" . This doesn't sound good. John and Beauty ride out to fetch Doctor White at Squire Gordon's request.<PARAGRAPH>When they reach a long, flat stretch of road, John urges Beauty on, saying, \"Now, Beauty, do your best\" . Beauty doesn't need to be told twice, and gallops \"as fast as I could lay my feet to the ground. I don't believe my old grandfather, who won the race at Newmarket, could have gone faster\" . Well then. They race the eight miles to town and seek out Doctor White. John tells Doctor White that Mrs. Gordon might die without help.<PARAGRAPH>Doctor White says that his own horse is badly in need of rest, and John tells him to take Beauty back, even though he's just run all the way there: \"Black Beauty will go till he drops\" , John says.<PARAGRAPH>Even though the doctor is heavier and not a great rider, Beauty does his best, taking him back to Squire Gordon's as fast as he can. Once back at the stable, Beauty is wiped out--he's drenched, steaming, and shaking with the effort of making the run. Little Joe tries to take care of him, but has no experience, and doesn't know to put a warm cloth on Beauty's back to prevent a chill.<PARAGRAPH>Unfortunately Joe's inexperience proves to be a problem. Beauty begins to \"shake and tremble  My legs ached my loins ached, and my chest ached, and I felt sore all over\" . Uh-oh...<PARAGRAPH>When John finally arrives after a long while, Beauty actually moans in pain. John fixes Beauty up with warm cloths and food, and seems very upset that Joe didn't properly care for Beauty.<PARAGRAPH>Even more unfortunately, Beauty gets very sick because of his post-run chill, but John cares for him, even getting up during the night to tend to the horse. Squire Gordon also visits, telling Beauty that he saved the mistress's life.<PARAGRAPH>John tells Squire Gordon that it seemed like Beauty knew what was happening that night, to which Beauty tells us, \"Of course I did\" . We believe you, Beauty.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201205154804/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/black-beauty/summary/chapter-18"}
