{"name": "Chapter 25", "summary": "Jurgis is humiliated by Hamilton's treatment, but he's still delighted: he has a hundred dollar bill!<PARAGRAPH>But where is he supposed to use it? He'll have to find somewhere to break the hundred into more usable bills.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis goes into a bar and asks if he can have change for a hundred.<PARAGRAPH>The bartender says he'll change it if Jurgis buys something. Jurgis orders a beer.<PARAGRAPH>The bartender gives Jurgis his beer - and 95 cents in change.<PARAGRAPH>When Jurgis protests that he gave the bartender a hundred, the bartender tells Jurgis he's crazy and tries to kick Jurgis out of the bar.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis attacks the bartender, which is what the bartender wants.<PARAGRAPH>The bartender knocks Jurgis out and calls the cops.<PARAGRAPH>The bartender accuses Jurgis of pulling a knife on him.<PARAGRAPH>A cop on the scene uses his billy club to beat the crap out of Jurgis.<PARAGRAPH>In the hub-bub, the bartender stows the hundred-dollar bill away.<PARAGRAPH>Then the cop drags Jurgis to the police station.<PARAGRAPH>When Jurgis is taken in for sentencing, he can't explain where he got the hundred-dollar bill. Or rather, he can explain, but no one believes him.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis tells the courtroom that a man gave the money to Jurgis freely when Jurgis had been begging on the street.<PARAGRAPH>The judge thinks Jurgis is a drunk and a liar - and Jurgis's record of biting people's cheeks doesn't help - so the judge sentences Jurgis to ten days in jail plus costs.<PARAGRAPH>So, Jurgis gets carted off to jail again.<PARAGRAPH>Oddly, he finds Jack Duane, the dashing safe cracker, in the same prison.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis tells Jack Duane what's happened to him since they last met in jail.<PARAGRAPH>Jack Duane replies that he's in jail yet again on a fake charge.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis doesn't see many familiar faces in jail, but it's all the same kind of guy.<PARAGRAPH>And Jurgis realizes that he's going to be one of them. When he gets out of jail, he has decided to become a real criminal.<PARAGRAPH>So, after Jurgis is released, he decides to go seek out Jack Duane to see if he can be of any help to Jack.<PARAGRAPH>He finds Jack Duane in the back room of a pawnbroker and a fence for stolen goods.<PARAGRAPH>Jack Duane is glad to see Jurgis because he needs Jurgis's help  to start doing some mugging.<PARAGRAPH>The two wait at the side of the road for rich-looking guys to rob.<PARAGRAPH>They split the proceeds equally and make pretty good money.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis reads about the victim the next day - the guy's going to lose three fingers to frostbite after being knocked unconscious - and Jurgis feels guilty.<PARAGRAPH>Still, Jack Duane says it's either that guy or them, and he'd pick the other guy every time.<PARAGRAPH>In this rotten system, that guy is probably exploiting or hurting someone else. He deserves what he gets.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis gets up close and personal with Chicago's criminal world.<PARAGRAPH>He discovers that businessmen use lots of money to pay off the city's officials to serve their interests. That's the big picture.<PARAGRAPH>But in more local corruption, the police, fire, and water departments have more direct relationships with ordinary businesspeople.<PARAGRAPH>So, all the bars pay off cops to look the other way when they serve liquor on Sunday.<PARAGRAPH>All the brothels pay the cops to look the other way when they engage in prostitution.<PARAGRAPH>There are tons of these kinds of street-level bribes to keep the city's criminal activities going strong.<PARAGRAPH>Jack Duane introduces Jurgis to a political operative named \"Buck\" Halloran.<PARAGRAPH>This guy sends Jurgis in to collect election bribes under a series of different names - \"Johann Schmidt,\" \"Serge Reminitsky,\" and \"Michael O'Flaherty.\" Politicians are buying votes, and Jurgis is the frontman for this operation.<PARAGRAPH>Because Jurgis now associates with an important political machine, he suddenly has pull in court.<PARAGRAPH>This means that, when he appears on trial again on a drunk and disorderly charge, he's given a slap on the wrist and allowed to go. What a change of luck!<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis and Jack Duane keep mugging people and making cash.<PARAGRAPH>They do this by bribing a bartender to look the other way while they track down drunk people coming in from out of town to rob.<PARAGRAPH>So, naturally, they become friendly with this bartender who they keep paying off.<PARAGRAPH>The bartender points them in the direction of a guy named Goldberger.<PARAGRAPH>Goldberger gives Jurgis and Jack Duane tips about who they should rob next .<PARAGRAPH>Goldberger also lets them in on some sweet information about horse racing in New Orleans. Apparently, all these races are rigged, and Goldberger knows about them.<PARAGRAPH>So, Jurgis and Jack Duane get in on horse betting as well.<PARAGRAPH>Around this time, Jurgis and Jack Duane part ways.<PARAGRAPH>Jack Duane gets caught red-handed drilling into a safe and has to leave town.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis, meanwhile, bumps into that night-watchman from all the way back in Chapter 9, who got Jurgis his citizenship. This is the guy who bought Jurgis's vote for a local political machine.<PARAGRAPH>Now that they have met up again, the night-watchman makes Jurgis an offer.<PARAGRAPH>The night-watchman works for a guy named \"Bush\" Harper, who in turn works for Mike Scully, one of the richest and most influential men in Packingtown.<PARAGRAPH>Mike Scully is a Democrat, but he has worked out a back-room deal with the local Republican party for the next couple of elections.<PARAGRAPH>The next Democratic nominee for a city council position is a rich Jewish man.<PARAGRAPH>Mike Scully isn't very invested in the Democratic nominee because he has his own prejudices.<PARAGRAPH>Scully himself, however, is coming up for reelection in the next election after this.<PARAGRAPH>So, what Scully secretly offers the Republicans is this: he will give them money from this poor Democratic nominee's election fund as long as the Republicans promise not to raise a candidate against Mike Scully in the following election after this.<PARAGRAPH>It's a trade of city council positions: Mike Scully will sacrifice this election as long as he is guaranteed to win the next one.<PARAGRAPH>The one trouble in this deal is that there is a new movement gaining steam in the packing yards: socialism.<PARAGRAPH>Mike Scully is worried that the hot-head Democrats of Packingtown would prefer to go with the Socialist Party candidate over some random Republican.<PARAGRAPH>So \"Bush\" Harper hires Jurgis, who is well-known as a union man and has lots of union connections.<PARAGRAPH>He wants Jurgis to go back to the meatpacking plants to lobby for the Republican candidate with his old union buddies.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis doesn't see how this is going to work, since he's been blacklisted from working in Packingtown.<PARAGRAPH>\"Bush\" Harper promises that won't be a problem.<PARAGRAPH>So Jurgis agrees, and he gets to meet Mike Scully, the most important man in Packingtown.<PARAGRAPH>Mike Scully personally gives Jurgis a note to take to the head manager of Durham's packing plant, Mr. Harmon.<PARAGRAPH>The note tells Harmon to hire Jurgis as a personal favor to Mike Scully.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Harmon offers Jurgis a job as a night watchman.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis refuses because he needs to be surrounded by the workers.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Harmon lets Jurgis take a job trimming hogs.<PARAGRAPH>Again, what a reversal of luck: Jurgis once begged for this job and was refused. Now, he gets automatically appointed to the hog-killing room.<PARAGRAPH>The boss of the room, \"Pat\" Murphy, is specifically ordered to make room for Jurgis.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis joins the union again right away. He tells everyone to vote for \"Scotty\" Doyle - the Republican candidate. He also trashtalks the millionaire who is the Democratic candidate - what does he know about the working man?<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis brings dozens of guys to join the Doyle the Republican's campaign.<PARAGRAPH>This is how Jurgis becomes a politician without making a single speech: by working hard around the factory drumming up support for a candidate he doesn't care about at all with the secret backing of Mike Scully.<PARAGRAPH>So, when reliably Democratic Packingtown elects a Republican representative, Jurgis goes out on a bender with the money he has made fixing the election.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210123044944/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/the-jungle/summary/chapter-25"}
