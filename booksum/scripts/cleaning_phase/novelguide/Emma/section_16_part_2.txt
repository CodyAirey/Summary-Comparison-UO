{"name": "volume 3, Chapter 50", "summary": "Chapter 50: Emma and Mr. Knightley go in to tea, and Mr. Woodhouse has no idea of any change with them, as they have decided not to tell anyone yet. That night Emma worries about how Harriet and her father will take the engagement between her and Mr. Knightley. She thought that while her father lived, they could not be married, but must only be engaged. She decides to avoid a meeting with Harriet and to arrange for her to visit Isabella in London for a few weeks. The next day she gets a letter from Mrs. Weston with a forwarded letter from Frank to Mrs. Weston. In it he says that he is sorry that they had to hide their engagement. He says that he is sorry that he pretended to be attached to Emma, but that he would not have done it if he had not been sure of her indifference to him. He goes on to admit that he sent the piano to Jane. He explains why the engagement had to come out like it did, by saying that after Jane had gotten fed up with his relationship with Emma, she called off the wedding and agreed to the situation that Mrs. Elton had found her. The only way that Frank could think to keep her was to bring the engagement out in the open", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210421073237/http://www.novelguide.com/emma/summaries/chap49-51"}
