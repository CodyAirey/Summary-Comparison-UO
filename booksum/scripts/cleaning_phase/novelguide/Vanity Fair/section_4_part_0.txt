It informs him that Osborne senior no longer considers him a member of the family. He is allowed to have the PS2,000 of his dead mother's estate but declines any form of communication from now on. Osborne's first reaction is to blame Dobbin for rushing him into marriage. He does not think he can live on such a 'pittance'. Dobbin tells him he will help out his widow financially if he is killed in the war and forgives him for 'abusing him without cause'.<PARAGRAPH>After a week of marriage, Amelia feels neglected by Osborne as he spends time with Rawdon and Becky.

Becky dictates a letter for Rawdon to write to his aunt and lets her know that Mrs Bute Crawley encouraged his attachment to Becky . Despite Becky's attempts, Miss Crawley can see that Becky dictated this as Rawdon usually writes to her to ask for money. After agreeing to meet Rawdon alone, Miss Crawley writes to thank him for coming to Brighton. She tells him to visit her solicitor in London; he expects PS200 but only receives PS20.<PARAGRAPH>In Chapter Twenty Six, Amelia visits her parents in London and Osborne collects his PS2,000.

Amelia does not know why, but suddenly the day does not seem to shine so bright.<PARAGRAPH>Chapter Twenty Nine begins at the opera house.

Becky visits Amelia, and Amelia reproaches her for coming between her and her husband . The chapter ends with cannon fire and people running in the street.<PARAGRAPH>Analysis - Chapters Twenty Five, Twenty Six, Twenty Seven, Twenty Eight, Twenty Nine, Thirty and Thirty One<PARAGRAPH>Chapter Twenty Nine is significant for the descriptions of Osborne's neglect of Amelia in preference for Becky's flirtations. This is an important section when looking back at the whole novel as Amelia goes on to consider Osborne as saint-like after his death. This is a reminder of his vanity and disloyalty after only six weeks of marriage. By contrast, Dobbin demonstrates his concern for Amelia to the point of asking her brother to take care of her in Chapter Thirty.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200920105718/https://www.novelguide.com/vanity-fair/summaries/chapter25-31"}
