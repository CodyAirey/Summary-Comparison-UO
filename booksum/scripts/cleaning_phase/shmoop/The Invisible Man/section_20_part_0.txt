{"name": "Chapter 21", "summary": "Griffin continues his story:<PARAGRAPH>While he was still pretty excited to be invisible, he realized that invisibility had some drawbacks. For one thing, he couldn't see his feet, which made walking down stairs a little strange.<PARAGRAPH>The fact that people couldn't see him had advantages and disadvantages.<PARAGRAPH>Advantage: he got to pretend that a man's bucket was crazy.<PARAGRAPH>Disadvantage: a man running to catch the bucket jammed his fingers into Griffin's neck.<PARAGRAPH>Also, Griffin was always cold and started to get the sniffles. Oh, and a dog could totally find him.<PARAGRAPH>Wandering around London, Griffin came across a Salvation Army march, which drew a crowd. Crowds are dangerous to Griffin, since he can't slip through them - people can feel him even if they don't see him.<PARAGRAPH>He tried to get out of the way, but he had stepped in some mud and left muddy footprints. Some street urchins started to follow him, which is never good.<PARAGRAPH>Then it started to snow and Griffin got tired of his adventure. Of course, he couldn't go home since he had set his apartment on fire .<PARAGRAPH>Back in Kemp's study, listening to this story, Kemp looks out the window. What is he looking for? What does he see? Kemp asks Griffin to go on.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210623094503/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/invisible-man-wells/summary/chapter-21"}
