{"name": "chapter 33", "summary": "The world had come \nto an end for the pirates. The treasure for which they had sailed all the way \nhas gone. Silver is quick to recall to this. He passes a double barrel pistol \nto Jim. He asks Jim to get into cover and cautions Jim. Jim hears the buccaneers \nsaying that Silver had changed sides again.<PARAGRAPH>The pirates dig the pit to \nsee if they can find the already unearthed treasure. Morgan finds two gold guineas. \nMerry holds it aloft pointing it at Silver asking him if it is the seven hundred \nthousand pounds he had promised.<PARAGRAPH>Silver, unperturbed by his taunt, asks \nthem to dig hard to find some pig-nuts. He asks if George is again attempting \nto Captain the crew. But by now the crew is against Silver. George Merry gets \nready to make a speech.<PARAGRAPH>He slowly raises his arm to signal an attack on \nSilver when three bullet shots from the thicket hit him. His men flee for life. \nSilver gives the final touches to the body as he empties two barrels of pistol \ninto the fallen man. The Doctor, Gray and Ben Gunn appears from the thicket. They \nthink that the other pirates had fled towards the boat. Dr. Livesey and the gang \nfollow. Silver keeps pace with them. They slow down when they find out that the \nmen are not running towards the boat.<PARAGRAPH>The Doctor narrates the story of \nBen Gunn finding the treasure long ago and that it was safe. He tells them that \nhe had traded the map only after he met Ben Gunn.<PARAGRAPH>Silver thanks his stars \nto have Jim by his side. Failing which, the Doctor accepts, he would have been \ndead. When they reach the sea, they get in a gig boat and make their way to the \nNorth Dulet. They see the Squire standing by Ben Gunn. When they reach the north \ninlet, they see the Hispaniola cruising by herself. Gray handles the ship \nalone and after pulling it over to Ben Gunns cave, guarded it the whole night. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Your browser does not support the IFRAME tag.<PARAGRAPH>They enter the cave. Captain Smollet is lying beside the \nfire and the light from the blaze flickers the pile of Flints treasure. Jim is \ndumbstruck to see the amount of wealth accumulated in the form of gold bars and \ncoins. The Captain welcomes Jim. Silver is asked what he was up to this time, \nto which he promptly replies that he is back to his old duty.<PARAGRAPH>They sit \ndown and have supper. Jim recalls this moment as the happiest one he has had in \nthe whole journey.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Treasure_Island/Treasure_Island37.html"}
