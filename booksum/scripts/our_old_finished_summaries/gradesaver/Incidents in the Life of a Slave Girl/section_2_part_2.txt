He still visited her and labored to convince her of how she had lowered herself. She knew that she had no chance of having a better life. What made her the most despairing was when he threatened to sell her child. Harriet learned she was to be a mother again, and Dr. Flint became crazed. He cut her hair extremely short and once pushed her down a flight of stairs. He was like a \"restless spirit from the pits\" and visited her daily. Harriet had her baby and was disconsolate when she learned it was a girl, since slave girls have \"wrongs, and sufferings, and mortifications peculiarly their own. One day when Dr. Flint was out of town Harriet had her children christened. They could not take their father's name so they took the name of Harriet's father. Harriet felt ashamed that her lot was so different than that of her own mother, who had been married and could give her children their father's name", "analysis": "In these chapters Harriet experiences the torturous and malevolent persecutions of Dr. Flint. Her master can barely keep a lid on his emotions as he rages over the birth of her first and then second child, and then her escape from the plantation. Harriet's escape, as with all slave escapes, represents a disruption in the traditional master-slave dynamic of the paternalistic southern society.  All of southern economics, politics, society, and culture revolved around slavery, and dissension or threats to the system were vigilantly ferreted out and eradicated . Harriet's Incidents is a remarkable work in that it shows how mad the system of slavery actually was. The scholar Geneva Cobb Moore writes that Jacobs's narrative \"enabled her to record for her generation and posterity the sexualization of slavery as a severe form of its neuroses\". Her Freudian reading of the text illuminates the pathological problem of this entire society. The focus of Incidents is Jacobs's sexed body as legally defined property. Dr. Flint often tells her he can do with her what he wants, and this is sadly true. Slave girls' bodies were not their own, and the children certainly were not either. Jacobs's body \"emerges as a trope for the ascribed identity of female slaves and the institutionalization of slavery's erotic and neurotic character.\" Slavery presents a war between the slave, who tries to assert ownership over their body, and the master, who claims that the slave's body belongs to them. Because he adheres to the view that he owns Jacobs's body, Dr. Flint pursues her aggressively and neurotically until his own death years later. Although Freud did not articulate his theories until several years after the publication of Incidents, Jacobs's narrative anticipates the theories of hysteria, neurotic disorders, and libidinal sexual drives. Dr. Flint has obsessive and aggressive thoughts as well as actions towards Harriet. He is arrogant and attached to the romantic notion of his absolute power that being part of the planter aristocracy instilled in him. His behavior is clearly disturbing: he cannot help himself blurting out certain vile things to her; he strikes her occasionally, pushes her down the stairs, and violently cuts her hair; and he engages in secrecy and slyness in writing her notes and trying to seduce her. Moore notes that Dr. Flint's \"aggressive neurotic actions increase as his sexual anxieties mount and his sexual ambitions are rivaled.\" Harriet was right in her assumption that her involvement with Mr. Sands would disturb her master, but she most likely did not anticipate this reaction. Moore posits that, for her part, Harriet actually demonstrates a disturbing but understandable narcissism in response to his attention. She is clearly proud of her family lineage as well as her physical beauty. Freud \"described a compensatory relationship between women's beauty and their developing self-preservative narcissism.\" Harriet's beauty is able to raise her up slightly from her low social status and provides her with some leverage. When Dr. Flint proposes to set her up in a little house of her own, she even feels flattered. Overall, Incidents reveals the deeply pathological underpinnings of southern slave society, and through Dr. Flint in particular exemplifies the neuroses that result. Harriet's claim that slavery was not only bad for the slaves but for the whites as well certainly rings true."}
