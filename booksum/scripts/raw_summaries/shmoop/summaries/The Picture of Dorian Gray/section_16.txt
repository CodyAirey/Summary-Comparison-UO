They banter about aesthetics\u2014you know, the usual.<PARAGRAPH>Dorian goes off to fetch some orchids for the Duchess, and she and Henry keep chatting.

For the first time, we seem to have met a woman who can keep up with Dorian and Henry.<PARAGRAPH>The two of them hear a groan and a thud from the other end of the conservatory. Everyone is startled, and Lord Henry rushes over to see what happened: he finds Dorian, collapsed face downwards.<PARAGRAPH>The guests carry Dorian to a couch, and he comes to after a little while. He's obviously shaken up, and is still distraught. Henry, worried, tells him he should rest and not come down to dinner, but Dorian would rather be with the rest of the party than stay alone.<PARAGRAPH>The reason for Dorian's collapse, we learn, was that he saw a terrifying sight through the conservatory window\u2014James Vane.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210304030722/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/picture-dorian-gray/summary/chapter-17"}
