{"name": "Chapter XX", "summary": "Chapter XX: Steerforth's home. David accepts an invitation from Steerforth to stay for a day or two at his mother's home in Highgate, London, before going on to Yarmouth. David meets Mrs. Steerforth, a proud lady who dotes on her son and welcomes David on the grounds that he likes him, too. Rosa Dartle, Mrs. Steerforth's former companion and a distant relative of the family, also lives at the Steerforth home. Around thirty years of age, she is dark-haired, with an old scar on her lip. Rosa never says what she means directly, but talks in a mixture of hints and questions that are superficially innocent but are in fact barbed, bitter and sarcastic. When Steerforth talks patronizingly of Mr. Peggotty's family as \"that sort of people,\" Rosa questions him as to his meaning, and reveals that Steerforth believes that such people have \"not very fine natures\" and are \"not so easily wounded\" as more refined, higher-class people. Rosa sarcastically pretends to be grateful to be educated on the subject. Steerforth tells David that it was he who made the scar on Rosa's lip. As a boy, he became exasperated with her and threw a hammer at her. Mrs. Steerforth talks to David about her favorite subject: the wonderful qualities of her son. She says that she chose to send him to Mr. Creakle's school because of Mr. Creakle's recognition of Steerforth's superior nature", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210214143214/https://www.novelguide.com/david-copperfield/summaries/chapters-xix-xxii"}
