{"name": "Part 1, Chapter 4", "summary": "After Gulliver gets his freedom, the first thing he does is to ask the Emperor if he can go into Mildendo, the main city of Lilliput.<PARAGRAPH>The Emperor agrees, and Gulliver steps into the town. He walks through the main streets and visits the Emperor's palace.<PARAGRAPH>At this point, Gulliver spends some time describing the state of Lilliput itself, as told to him by Redresal, the country's principal secretary.<PARAGRAPH>Apparently, there are two rival factions in the empire, the Tramecksans and the Slamecksans.<PARAGRAPH>The Tramecksans are also called the \"high heels\" because they wear high-heeled shoes; the Slamecksans are the \"low heels.\"<PARAGRAPH>Even though the high heels are big fans of Lilliput's constitution, the Emperor will only staff his government with representatives of the low heels. <PARAGRAPH>The two parties hate each other so much that they can't eat, drink, or talk to each other.<PARAGRAPH>While the Emperor's heels are definitely low, his son, the heir to the throne, seems less decided: one of his heels is high, the other, low, which makes it tough for him to walk around. <PARAGRAPH>Not only is Lilliput divided inside, but it's also threatened from the outside by the island of Blefuscu, a second island empire \"almost as large and powerful as this of his majesty\" .<PARAGRAPH>Redresal admits that there may be countries outside the Lilliput/Blefuscu binary, but Lilliput's philosophers think there probably aren't. They like to believe that Gulliver is an alien who has dropped from the moon.<PARAGRAPH>The war between Lilliput and Blefuscu has been going on for three years.<PARAGRAPH>It all started with the grandfather of the current Emperor, who cut his finger on an eggshell when he was a kid.<PARAGRAPH>The Emperor's great-grandfather thinks that the reason his son cut his finger was because he broke his egg on its rounded, big end rather than the little, pointed end.<PARAGRAPH>Even though, up until this moment, everyone had always cracked their eggs on the big end, the current Emperor's great-grandfather decrees that, from now on, everyone will have to crack their eggs on the little end - for safety's sake!<PARAGRAPH>Redresal calls people who crack their eggs at the larger end Big-Endians; those who break their eggs at the smaller end are called Little-Endians.<PARAGRAPH><PARAGRAPH>The people are so against this new egg-cracking law that they keep rebelling against the Emperor. These uprisings get funding from Blefuscu, which is a country of Big-Endians.<PARAGRAPH>In fact, Blefuscu is currently calling up its navy for a full-scale invasion of Lilliput, because so many Big-Endian refugees from Lilliput's Little-Endian government have found their way to Blefuscu.<PARAGRAPH>The Emperor of Lilliput expects Gulliver to use his strength to defend the island, which is why he has commanded Redresal to tell Gulliver about the Big-End/Little-End conflict.<PARAGRAPH>Gulliver promises Redresal that he will do everything he can to protect Lilliput.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210619223131/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/gullivers-travels/summary/part-1-chapter-4"}
