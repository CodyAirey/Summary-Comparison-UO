{"name": "chapter xiii", "summary": "That night, Doctor Leete helps Julian West to adjust the music in his \n        room. The musical instruments are so finely adjusted to each individual \n        that it is possible for one person to listen while another, standing in \n        the same room, hears nothing. He sleeps soundly, having left his insomnia \n        in the nineteenth century, and wakes with a fantasy about being a Turkish \n        leader. The music that wakes him is the Turkish Reveille.<PARAGRAPH>At breakfast, he learns from Doctor Leete about the international situation \n        in the twentieth century. All the nations of Europe, Australia, Mexico, \n        and parts of South America are organized on the model of the United States. \n        The \u0093more backward races are gradually being educated up to civilized \n        institutions.\u0094 Every nation, nevertheless, enjoys full autonomy. The nations \n        carry on commerce without money, but by the use of account ledgers that \n        are balanced regularly. The prices charged to a foreign nation must be \n        the same as those charged to a nation\u0092s own citizens. All nations receive \n        the same prices. Doctor Leete explains that everyone is looking forward \n        to the consolidation of all the nations of the world under one head, and \n        good will is extended to other nations, just as it is extended to fellow \n        citizens. People are allowed to immigrate to other countries. The two \n        countries involved make an exchange on that basis. Only \u0093imbeciles\u0094 are \n        not allowed to immigrate. People are also allowed to travel at will. They \n        change their credit cards into those of the host nation, just as people \n        in the nineteenth century used to change their money into the currency \n        of the country they were visiting.<PARAGRAPH>As they leave the breakfast table, Edith Leete suggests they dine that \n        evening at the Elephant, a public dining room, where most people have \n        the main meal of the day. Julian West agrees that he would like to and \n        the plan is set.<PARAGRAPH>When he finds himself alone later that day, Julian West encounters Edith \n        Leete, who asks him if he would like to talk to some of his nineteenth-century \n        friends. These turn out to be all the books of his time. She takes him \n        to a library, where he picks up Dickens, who had always been his favorite. \n        He can read only a few sentences because the contrast between Dickens\u0092 \n        time and the twentieth century is so great. Reading Dickens, Julian West \n        is humbled at the thought that it is he, rather than someone more deserving, \n        who gets to see the twentieth century. He also reads Tennyson\u0092s \u0093Locksley \n        Hall,\u0094 wherein the poet imagines a future with no war, where universal \n        law keeps everyone at peace. Doctor Leete finds him in the library hours \n        later and is delighted that Julian West has chosen Dickens, a favorite \n        in the twentieth century because \u0093his great heart beat for the poor.\u0094", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025235/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Looking_Backward_Bellamy/Looking_Backward_Study_Guide12.html"}
