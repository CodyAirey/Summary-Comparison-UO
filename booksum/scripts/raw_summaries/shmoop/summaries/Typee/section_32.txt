{"name": "Chapter 33", "summary": "Ten days after the cannibalism was confirmed, Marnoo returns to the Typee Valley.<PARAGRAPH>Tommo asks if he can leave with him, but Marnoo says that he is taboo, and that even though white men are usually afraid to come to the valley, it seems like he has everything he needs: sleep, food, young girls.<PARAGRAPH>Tommo explains about his leg, but Marnoo cuts him off, saying that Mehevi will be upset and kill both of them. Still, Marnoo agrees to talk to his own chief, to see if Tommo could go there, then get taken to Nukuheva and on to freedom. He says this all in an angry voice, as if he is yelling at Tommo, rather than giving him an escape route.<PARAGRAPH>Tommo begins to plan, observing how he might get out of Marheyo's house undetected. Each night the door is closed, and the noise it makes when it opens tends to disturb sleepers. He resolves to get up for water, then not quite close the door behind him, only to leave thereafter.<PARAGRAPH>The night after Marnoo has left, Tommo makes his first attempt. Unfortunately, someone else gets up after him and soundly shuts the door. After this, Kory-Kory makes a point of leaving a gourd of water beside Tommo each night.<PARAGRAPH>Tommo tries again and again, but Kory-Kory rises to accompany him each time, ruining the means of escape.<PARAGRAPH>His leg worsens and most days Tommo is reduced to laying on the mat in Marheyo's, privately feeling angst out about his situation.<PARAGRAPH>Across from his hut, Marheyo is building another. Tommo watches him work.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201024203607/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/typee/summary/chapter-33"}
