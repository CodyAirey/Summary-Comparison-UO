It's gloomy, damp, and there's nothing to do.<PARAGRAPH>But then when she hears that Dickon might be out there she decides to go out after all.<PARAGRAPH>Martha also suggests that Mary keep her eyes open for the locked, walled garden.<PARAGRAPH>Apparently, it used to belong to Mr. Craven's wife, but when she died, Mr. Craven had the garden locked up.<PARAGRAPH>As Mary walks through the grounds and gardens of Misselthwaite Manor, she finds a wall so covered in ivy that it doesn't seem to have a door at all.<PARAGRAPH>As she goes looking for a door through the ivy, Mary meets an old man gardening.<PARAGRAPH>Even though he is not the friendliest guy in the world, Mary takes to him\u2014it's nice to have another human being around.

We've got the same nasty tempers, both of us, I'll warrant\" (4.132).<PARAGRAPH>(In other words, we're both bad-looking and bad-tempered, so let's be sort-of-friends.)<PARAGRAPH>Mary wonders, for the first time ever, if she actually is nasty-tempered.
