{"name": "Book the First: Recalled to LifeChapter One \u2013 The Period", "summary": "Okay, we know that this is a summary and all, but we just have to quote this opening for you. After all, it\u2019s one of the most well-known opening lines in English literature. Here goes:<PARAGRAPH>\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness [\u2026].\"<PARAGRAPH>The sentence goes on for awhile, but you get the general picture. There are lots of opposites at work in the good ol\u2019 eighteenth century.<PARAGRAPH>As our narrator points out, these opposites are also rather\u2026similar.<PARAGRAPH>Confused? Don\u2019t be. Your friendly Shmoop team is here to help.<PARAGRAPH>It\u2019s 1775.<PARAGRAPH>This chapter, the greatest of all openings, is a sort of guidebook to the time.<PARAGRAPH>If you\u2019re a backpacker, you could think of it as the Lonely Planet for the eighteenth century.<PARAGRAPH>We don\u2019t really meet any characters (but don\u2019t you worry, they\u2019ll be here soon enough).<PARAGRAPH>What we do get, however, is a breakdown of the important places in the novel: France and England.<PARAGRAPH>According to our helpful narrator, things in both countries are going along just as they\u2019ve always gone.<PARAGRAPH>In fact, everything is so dang normal that folks are pretty convinced that things will stay the same forever.<PARAGRAPH>That\u2019s our first hint that things are going wrong. Anytime anyone says that things are going to stay the same, there\u2019s a good chance that things are going to change. A lot. Anyone who\u2019s seen movies about high school friends going to college and growing apart knows that.<PARAGRAPH>To get back to our story, though: our narrator gives us a bird\u2019s-eye view of events in England.<PARAGRAPH>America has just flown the coop. People are pretty upset about that.<PARAGRAPH>(For those of you who\u2019d like a refresher course on the American Revolution, check out our Shmoop history notes on the subject. We\u2019re sticking to the other side of the pond in this novel.)<PARAGRAPH>In France, things aren\u2019t going so well. The economy is in a bit of a free-fall.<PARAGRAPH>Protestants are being persecuted (the French royalty, you see, is Catholic).<PARAGRAPH>In case you\u2019re thinking that England is a much, much nicer place to be, though, we should warn you: Catholics didn\u2019t fare so well in England, either.<PARAGRAPH>Our narrator predicts that trees growing in the fields of France will soon be cut and shaped into scaffolds and guillotines. Lovely.<PARAGRAPH>Back in England, lots of crimes occur on a regular basis. Just about everyone gets brutally punished, regardless of whether their crime was severe or trifling.<PARAGRAPH>In other words, things may be going along just as always\u2014but that sure doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re going along smoothly.<PARAGRAPH>That about sums up the  state of affairs.<PARAGRAPH>Our narrator offers up a foreboding reference to the Woodsman (Fate) and the Farmer (Death) who will be reaping and sowing their harvest very, very soon.<PARAGRAPH>Yup. Things are about to get ugly.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210115212823/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/tale-of-two-cities/summary/volume-1-chapter-1"}
