{"name": "Chapter XI", "summary": "Chapter XI. I begin Life on my own Account, and don't like it  I wonder what they thought of me. David's companions at Mr. Murdstone's business dismay David. They are coarse, uneducated boys whose fathers work in blue-collar professions. David meets Mr. Micawber, a poor but genteel man who speaks in tremendous phrases and makes a great show of nobility despite his shabby appearance. Through an agreement with Mr. Murdstone, David goes to live with Mr. Micawber, his wife, and four children. The Micawbers befriend David and openly tell him of their financial troubles, each time becoming overwhelmingly upset and then recovering fully over good food and wine. David gets very little pay at his factory job and lives primarily on bread. In retrospect, David wonders what the waiters and shopkeepers must have thought of him, so independent at so young an age. At the factory, David is known as \"the little gent\" and gets along fine because he never complains. Eventually, Mr. Micawber's debts overwhelm him. He is thrown into debtors' prison, where he becomes a political figure among the inmates, lobbying to eliminate that establishment", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210124215354/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/copperfield/section4/"}
