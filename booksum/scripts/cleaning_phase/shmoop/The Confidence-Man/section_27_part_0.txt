{"name": "Chapter 28", "summary": "Not cool.<PARAGRAPH>At least that's the cosmopolitan's response to the new guy's assertion at the end of the last chapter. Don't judge him, dude, he says. You don't know him. He's got a hard shell, but a heart of gold.<PARAGRAPH>The new guy is glad to hear it.<PARAGRAPH>On to more important things: the cosmopolitan thinks the story of Colonel Moredock is a tall tale. How could a guy with so much hate love the rest of humanity? That's just not sound reasoning, bro.<PARAGRAPH>The cosmopolitan also makes a case for misanthropy being akin to atheism: one denies kindness in humans just like the other denies love as something ordering the world.<PARAGRAPH>The two men bond over not having a frame of reference for determining what it means to be a misanthrope. They both just love humanity oh so much.<PARAGRAPH>The new guy wants to shake hands with the cosmopolitan because they're, like, so much alike.<PARAGRAPH>The men shake hands.<PARAGRAPH>The new guy says that now that they're besties, he and the cosmopolitan have to do what besties do best: drink together.<PARAGRAPH>The cosmopolitan would love to do that, totally, yeah, but he can't, because he already had too much while catching up with his other friends.<PARAGRAPH>Hold the phone. New guy is totally jealous that the cosmopolitan has other friends. But he tries to shake it off and act cool.<PARAGRAPH>You can have a little wine, the new guy says. Just a little.<PARAGRAPH>New guy is such an enabler.<PARAGRAPH>The cosmopolitan gets up and caves. He's so down.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20211017011430/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/confidence-man/summary/chapter-28"}
