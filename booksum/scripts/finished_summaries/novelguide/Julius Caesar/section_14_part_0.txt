This is the final blow for Cassius, who instructs Pindarus to kill him with his sword, the same sword that killed Caesar. Cassius dies. . Titanius and Messala enter, reporting that Brutus has triumphed over Octavius even as Cassius's army has fallen to Antony. They discover the dead Cassius.

Filled with grief, he kills himself. . Brutus enters with Messala, who has brought him the news of Cassius's death. Brutus exclaims that Caesar is mighty yet, and it is his spirit that has caused their defeat. He laments the death of two great Romans, and then tells his generals to prepare for another round of battle. .", "analysis": ".
