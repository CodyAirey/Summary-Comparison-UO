Aufidius admits that Coriolanus is proud, but says he can do nothing while he depends on him for the attack on Rome.

In the meantime, he believes that Rome will fall under Coriolanus's attack", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210212214204/https://www.novelguide.com/coriolanus/summaries/act-4-scenes-5-6-act-5-scene-1"}
