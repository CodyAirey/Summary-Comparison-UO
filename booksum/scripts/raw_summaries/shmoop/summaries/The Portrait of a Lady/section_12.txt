All in all, he\u2019s a successful and enterprising young businessman.<PARAGRAPH>Isabel considers the pros of Caspar Goodwood, but she ultimately can\u2019t get over the cons: He always dresses in the same way, his jaw is too square, and his posture too stiff. Oh, yeah \u2014 and she doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s in love with him.<PARAGRAPH>Isabel mentally compares Caspar Goodwood with Lord Warburton, appreciates the difference between them, and feels that she cannot commit herself to either of them.<PARAGRAPH>She writes Lord Warburton a letter thanking him, but rejecting his proposal.
