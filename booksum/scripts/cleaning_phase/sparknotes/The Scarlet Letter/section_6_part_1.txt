{"name": "Chapter 11", "summary": "Chapter 11: The Interior of a Heart Chillingworth continues to play mind games with Dimmesdale, making his revenge as terrible as possible. The minister often regards his doctor with distrust and even loathing, but because he can assign no rational basis to his feelings, he dismisses them and continues to suffer. Dimmesdale's suffering, however, does inspire him to deliver some of his most powerful sermons, which focus on the topic of sin. His struggles allow him to empathize with human weakness, and he thus addresses \"the whole human brotherhood in the heart's native language. Although the reverend deeply yearns to confess the truth of his sin to his parishioners, he cannot bring himself to do so.
