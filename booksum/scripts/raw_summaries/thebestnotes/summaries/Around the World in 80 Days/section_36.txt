{"name": "chapter 32", "summary": "Fogg\u2019s last hope seemed to have gone with the \u2018China\u2019, \nthe boat that leaves for Liverpool from New York. Passepartout is crushed by the \nfact that the boat has been missed because of him. Fogg merely says that they \nwill decide the next day, on what needs to be done. They stay the night at a Hotel \nand the next day, Fogg leaves the hotel alone, in order to look for a ship. He \nsees a trading vessel of fine lines-the \u2018Henrietta\u2019 and goes to meet the Captain. \nFogg wants to know, whether the Captain-Andrew Speedy-will take passengers to \nLiverpool. The latter refuses but Fogg manages to strike a deal, for a journey \nto Bordeaux. He offers two thousand dollars for each person and there are four. \nThus, the foursome-Fogg, Aouda, Passepartout and Fix board the ship-Henrietta-for \nBordeaux.<PARAGRAPH>Notes\nOnce again, Fogg shows his calm \ndemeanor. The ship \u2018China\u2019 had left only forty-five minutes before they reached \nNew York. The group now has no way of traveling to Liverpool at the speed that \nthe \u2018China\u2019 would have taken. While everybody is upset, Fogg makes the most reasonable \nand practical suggestion and that is to check into a hotel for the night and have \nsome rest. It is really humorous to note that while Fogg sleeps soundly, both \nAouda and Passepartout cannot rest because of their anxiety. They do not know \nhow they are going to come out of their predicament. The next morning Fogg goes \nlooking for a ship alone. One can almost imagine this handsome Englishman, going \nabout calmly trying to find a solution to his problem. It is the best way, which \nworks for him. The man is designed to find solutions and to work efficiently. \nHe does find a reasonable looking ship-the Henrietta but this time the Captain \nof the ship is unreasonable. So far, Fogg has been lucky to come across reliable \nand good-natured sailors to take him on special boats but we now see that Fogg\u2019s \nluck is running into a bad patch. Andrew Speedy is greedy and selfish. But, Fogg \nmanages to strike a deal and that is to take the passengers to Bordeaux. We wonder \nwhy Fogg agrees to Bordeaux and the question in our mind is answered in the next \nchapter.<PARAGRAPH>While all that Fogg is thinking about is the completion of his \njourney, Passepartout is very worried about the financial loss that he has caused \nhis master. Fix has something else to mope about, he knows that Fogg has already \nspent a great part of the reward money, so he wonders what will be left for himself \nafter Fogg is arrested.<PARAGRAPH>Our passengers start their journey on the Henrietta. \nWe wait and see what happens next.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141554/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Around_The_World_In_80_Days/Around_The_World_In_Eighty_Days30.html"}
