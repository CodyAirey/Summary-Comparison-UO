{"name": "Chapter 3", "summary": "The Whites bury Herbert in a cemetery two miles from their house. Their home is now a dark and lonely place.<PARAGRAPH>The Whites feel like they are waiting for something to happen to help them with their sadness.<PARAGRAPH>One night, about a week later, Mrs. White remembers the monkey's paw.<PARAGRAPH>She wants Mr. White to wish Herbert back to life. Mr. White, who isn't sure whether Herbert's death has anything to do with the paw, is totally against this idea.<PARAGRAPH>But Mrs. White won't take no for an answer, so Mr. White, against his own judgment, wishes Herbert back to life.<PARAGRAPH>Nothing happens.<PARAGRAPH>They go back to bed. Mr. White is relieved. Herbert has been dead ten days and his body looked really horrible ten days ago. (Fatal factory accidents do that to a body.) Mr. White has no desire to see the undead version of his son.<PARAGRAPH>After a while, the Whites hear someone \u2013 or something \u2013 banging on the front door.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. White decides that it just took Herbert a little while to get home, because the graveyard where he was buried is two miles away. She runs downstairs to welcome home undead Herbert.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. White is scared. He wants nothing to do with undead Herbert.<PARAGRAPH>He quickly makes his third wish. The story doesn't say what this wish is, but the knocking stops just as Mrs. White gets the door open.<PARAGRAPH>When she steps outside, nobody there and the road is empty. She screams because Herbert isn't there.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. White goes outside and comforts her.<PARAGRAPH>Want to talk about the ending?
