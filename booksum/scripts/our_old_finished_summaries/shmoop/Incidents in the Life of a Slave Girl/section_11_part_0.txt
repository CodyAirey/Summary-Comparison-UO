Worried that the slaves may be planning a revolt, the slaveholders in Edenton hire poor whites to search everyone. Dozens of slaves--men, women and children--are whipped and tortured. Linda cleans her grandmother's house to get the searchers off her back. Mr. Litch, a neighboring slaveholder, leads the search of Aunt Martha's house. They ask her what she's doing with so many letters, and she says they're poetry from one of her white friends. The search team leaves after not finding anything incriminating, and you can imagine they're a little disappointed. This goes on for weeks. It doesn't manage to turn up any plots for rebellion--although if you're just looking at numbers of people tortured and jailed, it's a huge success.", "analysis": ""}
