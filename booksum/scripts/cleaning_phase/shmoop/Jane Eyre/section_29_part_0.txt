{"name": "Volume 3, Chapter 4", "summary": "Jane continues to regain her strength living at Moor House. She's especially happy because, now that she's met Diana and Mary, she finally has some real friends of her own. The three women spend a lot of time together reading, talking, and walking on the moor. Diana starts teaching Jane German.<PARAGRAPH>Jane doesn't really develop a friendship with St. John. For one thing, he's not around a lot; he goes out visiting the sick and needy all the time, in all weathers. For another, he's a bit too reserved and cold to get friendly with her very fast.<PARAGRAPH>When Jane hears St. John preach, she's amazed at how powerful and intense he is, but also realizes that he's a really unhappy person.<PARAGRAPH>Diana and Mary prepare to move away and become governesses.<PARAGRAPH>Jane talks to St. John about the job he's promised to find for her. He says that he's been waiting until after his sisters leave to start their new jobs.<PARAGRAPH>St. John tells Jane about his family's poverty and warns her that he won't be able to get her a really great job, but he thinks she'll take what he found.<PARAGRAPH>St. John explains that he is the clergyman in the little town of Morton and that, when he came there two years ago, it didn't have a school. He established a boys' school and he's been meaning to establish a girls' school, too, funded by the rich factory owner in the town, Mr. Oliver. He asks Jane to run this school; she'll have a salary of thirty pounds a year  and even a little house of her own beside the school.<PARAGRAPH>Jane accepts the post, which involves teaching village girls to read, write, do math, sew, and knit.<PARAGRAPH>Diana and Mary are very sad about having to leave; they might not see their brother again for a long time after they take up their new jobs.<PARAGRAPH>St. John gets a letter stating that the Rivers' Uncle John is dead. Jane watches as all the members of the Rivers family behave somewhat strangely about this--they're not exactly sad; she's not sure what they're feeling. St. John explains that their uncle had argued with their father long before, and that he had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, but decided to leave all the money to another relative.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210616205841/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/jane-eyre/summary/volume-3-chapter-4"}
