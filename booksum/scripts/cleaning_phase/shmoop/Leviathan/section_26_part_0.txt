Then he gives them the bad news: not enough things are getting repaired, and they may have to let the Leviathan die in order to save the people aboard.<PARAGRAPH>Deryn isn't okay with this though, and she tells Newkirk that Alek is going to help them.<PARAGRAPH>In a hurry to find out where Alek lives, she ascends while the captain is still talking.<PARAGRAPH>Up in the Huxley, Deryn scans the horizon, discovering the castle Alek came from.<PARAGRAPH>Then she spots the walker heading toward the Leviathan; she flashes a message down.<PARAGRAPH>She sees the Austrian crest and figures out that Alek isn't Swiss--and therefore, isn't neutral--so she jabbers a message to her message lizard and sends it down the rope.<PARAGRAPH>She realizes that only Alek will be able to stop the walker from attacking. The message lizard isn't moving fast enough.<PARAGRAPH>Deryn needs to go down herself, however tricky that may be.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210507031130/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/leviathan/summary/chapter-27"}
