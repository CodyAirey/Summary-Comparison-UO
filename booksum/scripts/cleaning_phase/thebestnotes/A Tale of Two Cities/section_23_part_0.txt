Regaining his \ncomposure, Mr. Lorry assures Lucie that he will look after the Doctor while she and Darnay are away on their \nhoneymoon. When Dr. Manette and Darnay emerge from the room, the doctor is shaken and looks deathly pale.<PARAGRAPH>Everyone makes their way to the church for the ceremony.
