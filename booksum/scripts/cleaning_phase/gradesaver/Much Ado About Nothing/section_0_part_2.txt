{"name": "act 1, Scene 2", "summary": "PARAGRAPH>Scene Two<PARAGRAPH>Leonato and Antonio, his elder brother, meet and discuss Leonato's guests. Antonio informs Leonato that a servant of his overheard Don Pedro and Claudio speaking together in his peach orchard. The man reported that Don Pedro told Claudio he loved Hero and would acknowledge it that night at the dance, intending to go to Leonato if he found Hero consenting. Leonato is excited by this news, but tells Antonio to keep it a secret until Don Pedro actually comes to him. He only decides to tell Hero so that she may prepare an answer", "analysis": "Much Ado About Nothing opens in a liminal situation with a war that has just ended. The men enter a \"golden world\" in Messina where the women are already located. In this situation, people fail to take things seriously, causing the war of the wombs to soon turn into a war of words. Benedick and Beatrice are the main examples of male/female rivalry that converts into belligerent wordplay.<PARAGRAPH>The first act portrays all the characters as being very careful to observe social norms, especially those of civilian obligations to the military. This creates a mask of politeness that slowly dissipates throughout the play until by the end there is nothing but directness of speech left. However, the first exchange between Leonato and Don Pedro is a model of politeness, with each man dismissing the problems of having guests for a month as being meaningless. Don Pedro further catalyzes the entire plot by carefully maneuvering the conversation towards Hero, Leonato's daughter.<PARAGRAPH>Don Pedro: \"Good Signor Leonato, are you come to meet your<PARAGRAPH>trouble? The fashion of the world is to avoid cost, and you<PARAGRAPH>encounter it.<PARAGRAPH>Leonato: \"Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of<PARAGRAPH>your grace; for trouble being gone, comfort should remain, but<PARAGRAPH>when you depart from me, sorrow abides and happiness takes<PARAGRAPH>his leave.<PARAGRAPH>Don Pedro: \"You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this<PARAGRAPH>is your daughter.<PARAGRAPH>Leonato: Her mother hath many times told me so\" <PARAGRAPH>Much Ado About Nothing is primarily a play about gossip.Indeed, what does the title mean? It indicates a big fuss about a trifle, and by the end this is exactly what happens. All of Claudio's accusations will come to nothing, causing the play to end the same way as if they never occurred at all.<PARAGRAPH>Shakespeare brilliantly plays on the meanings of nothing throughout this play. The word \"nothing\" would actually have been pronounced \"noting\" in his time. It can mean worthless, a person of little worth, or also mean everything, in the sense that much ado is made about everything. Alternatively \"nothing\" is a word that means female genitalia, Hero's \"nothing\", an interpretation of the word that is evidenced by how ashamed Hero is of sexual desire.<PARAGRAPH>The pronunciation of \"nothing\" plays on \"noting\" as well. To note is to observe or mark carefully, something everyone in the play fails to do. It can also mean to stigmatize or point out, exactly what Claudio does to Hero in the church. Indeed, Claudio's first comment about Hero is whether anyone else noted her, \"didst thou note the daughter of Signor Leonato?\" . Benedick tells him, \"I noted her not, but I looked on her\" , at which point he proceeds to stigmatize her. Benedick jokes about her complexion and height, thereby \"noting\" Hero in his own way.<PARAGRAPH>Silence is something that Shakespeare always views with suspicion, and this play is no different. Silence is actually worse than talking because it leads to plotting and conniving. As Don John says, \"I am not a man of many words\" , thereby marking him as a man who instead will plot against the others. Indeed, it is soon obvious that silence is worse than talking too much, something that Beatrice and Benedick do. The danger of silence also affects the relationship between Hero and Claudio. Since they fail to talk with one another, they never resolve questions relating to the other's motives. Indeed, a crucial first mistake for Claudio is when he allows Don Pedro to speak to Hero for him, thereby creating confusion about Don Pedro's true motives.<PARAGRAPH>Don John is the evil bastard brother in the play. He is only recently reconciled with Don Pedro and he plays the role of a schemer, a discontent and a machiavel. In reality, Don John is merely the excluded character, a man who cannot fit into the society he is unwillingly a part of. When Conrad tries to tell him he should act happy around Don Pedro, he states, \"I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace\" . Don John thus ignores the family network, fails to observe the proper code of conduct, misses the dinner party thrown by Leonato, and rebels against the compulsory set of social rules.<PARAGRAPH>The melancholy of Don John is noted by Conrad who says, \"why are you thus out of measure sad?\" . Don John represents the sadness that is a recurring theme in Shakespeare's comedies. Shylock and Antonio in Merchant of Venice and Egeus in The Comedy of Errors who is condemned to die are other characters who are melancholy. There is no reason for this sadness, and it breeds on itself.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210421083627/https://www.gradesaver.com/much-ado-about-nothing/study-guide/summary-act-1"}
