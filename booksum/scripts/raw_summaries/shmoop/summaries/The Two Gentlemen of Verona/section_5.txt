{"name": "Act 2, Scene 3", "summary": "Lance (Proteus's servant) and Crab (Lance's dog) enter the stage and Lance makes a big speech to the audience about how he must accompany Proteus to the \"Emperor's\" court in Milan. Lance's entire family is upset that Lance is leaving. His mom's \"weeping,\" his dad's \"wailing,\" his sister's \"crying,\" the maid's \"howling,\" etc. The only member of the family that couldn't care less is Lance's beloved dog, Crab.<PARAGRAPH>To demonstrate his dog's indifference, Lance takes off his shoes and then proceeds to use his footwear, a staff (walking stick), and a hat as props to reenact what went down at his family home when he broke the sad news of his imminent departure.<PARAGRAPH>Panthino enters, interrupting Lance's little skit, and orders Lance aboard the ship that's setting sail for Milan. (Yeah, we know Verona and Milan are landlocked, but Shakespeare really likes to incorporate sea voyages into his plays\u2014he even managed to sneak one into Hamlet.)<PARAGRAPH>Lance can hardly speak because he's sobbing about his cruel, unloving dog, who isn't even sad to see him go.<PARAGRAPH>One dirty joke and some silly banter later, Panthino finally convinces Lance to board the ship to avoid losing his job as Proteus's servant.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219163530/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/gentlemen-of-verona/summary/act-2-scene-3"}
