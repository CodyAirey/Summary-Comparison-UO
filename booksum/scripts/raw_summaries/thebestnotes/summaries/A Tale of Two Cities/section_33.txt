{"name": "chapter four: calm in a storm", "summary": "After four days, Dr. Manette finally returns from La Force. He tells of the horrors committed there by the mob and the \nthousands of people that have been killed. He has seen the self-appointed tribunal, which summarily tries the prisoners \nand sentences them to death. In an effort to save Darnay, he presents himself to the tribunal, one of whom is Defarge, and \ntells them of his past. He uses all his influence to have a quick and fair trial for Darnay, hoping he will be heard and \nreleased. He is told, however, that Darnay will remain imprisoned.<PARAGRAPH>While he and Lucie wait for Darnay\u0092s trial and release, Dr. Manette devotes himself to working as a physician. Before \nlong, he is appointed as the inspecting doctor for three prisons, among them La Force. As a result, he can regularly check \non his son-in-law. He is delighted to find that Darnay is no longer in solitary confinement, but mixed with a general body \nof prisoners. He is also happy to be able to bring messages from Darnay to Lucie.<PARAGRAPH>Darnay lies in prison for one and a half years. During this time, a new era \n        begins; France is made a republic -- of Liberty, Freedom, Equality, or \n        Death. The king is tried for treason, condemned, and executed by guillotine. \n        A Law of Suspects is created to allow the government to imprison anyone \n        who is suspected of any crime. A new tribunal is set up and given extraordinary \n        powers to try summarily all those charged with any hostility to the state. \n        A Committee of General Security and a Committee of Public Safety are formed \n        to hunt down and punish political crimes. The Reign of Terror has truly \n        set in. During all these changes, Dr. Manette never stops trying to have \n        Darnay freed.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Dickens/A_Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Study_Guide24.html"}
