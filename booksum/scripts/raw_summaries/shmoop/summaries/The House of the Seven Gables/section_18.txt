{"name": "Chapter 19", "summary": "Uncle Venner is the first person awake the morning after the storm.<PARAGRAPH>Everything looks clean and refreshed, even the House of the Seven Gables.<PARAGRAPH>The most eye-catching thing about the whole house is the full bloom of Alice's Posies, the flowers sown by Alice Pyncheon so many years before.<PARAGRAPH>Uncle Venner stops by the House of the Seven Gables for scraps to feed his pig.<PARAGRAPH>He's surprised that Hepzibah hasn't left him anything.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Holgrave sees Uncle Venner at the gate. Uncle Venner explains that no one is up yet. He asks if the wind kept Mr. Holgrave up the night before.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Holgrave replies, \"If I were a believer in ghosts [...] I should have concluded that all the old Pyncheons were running riot in the lower rooms\" (19.7).<PARAGRAPH>But it's all very quiet now.<PARAGRAPH>Uncle Venner mentions that he saw Judge Pyncheon in the shop the day before.<PARAGRAPH>Uncle Venner suggests that Mr. Holgrave pick one of Alice's Posies and keep it in water until Phoebe comes back.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Holgrave agrees that the water of Maule's well suits Alice's Posies the best.<PARAGRAPH>Uncle Venner goes on his way.<PARAGRAPH>The next visitor is an angry housewife, Mrs. Gubbins. She wants to buy half a pound of pork. A neighbor across the street tells her not to bother: nobody's home.<PARAGRAPH>Well, that's too bad, says the neighbor across the way \u2013 both Hepzibah and Clifford have gone off with Judge Pyncheon.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Gubbins thinks that's unlikely: everyone knows that Hepzibah and Judge Pyncheon have had a falling out, and that's why Hepzibah is so poor.<PARAGRAPH>The neighbor claims only a blood relative like Judge Pyncheon would bother to help out dreadful Hepzibah and Clifford.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Gubbins stalks off.<PARAGRAPH>Ned Higgins goes up the street on his way to school and stops to buy a cookie.<PARAGRAPH>He bangs on the door because he wants \"an elephant!\" (19.23).<PARAGRAPH>The little brat almost throws a stone through the window, but a passerby stops him in time.<PARAGRAPH>Ned sobs, \"They won't open the door; and I can't get my elephant!\" (19.26).<PARAGRAPH>The man sends Ned off to school.<PARAGRAPH>The man then turns to his friend Dixey and wonders what has happened to the Pyncheons.<PARAGRAPH>It's odd because Judge Pyncheon \u2013 who is a man of very regular habits \u2013 didn't come home the night before.<PARAGRAPH>Dixey thinks Judge Pyncheon will be fine. He speculates that Hepzibah has gotten into debt and run off.<PARAGRAPH>Several delivery people stop by throughout the morning but they get no answer at the door.<PARAGRAPH>The butcher peeps through the window and sees someone sitting down in the parlor.<PARAGRAPH>He thinks it's Clifford ignoring the doorbell and drives off in a snit.<PARAGRAPH>The man with the barrel-organ and the monkey stops to play outside of the house.<PARAGRAPH>A crowd of children collect. They argue over whether anyone is home.<PARAGRAPH>The man with the barrel-organ keeps playing, hoping to catch a glimpse of Phoebe or Clifford.<PARAGRAPH>The children finally get bored and tell him to go along.<PARAGRAPH>Two men passing by tell the barrel-organ player to be quiet.<PARAGRAPH>One of them says the Pyncheons will be wanting no music: \"it is reported all over town that Judge Pyncheon, who owns the house, has been murdered [...] So be off with you, at once!\" (19.46)<PARAGRAPH>The barrel-organ player finds a card on the doorstep. It belonged to Judge Pyncheon and has a bunch of appointments written on the back.<PARAGRAPH>Dixey decides they have to bring the card to the city marshal.<PARAGRAPH>Dixey thinks Clifford \"may have been up at his old tricks\" (19.49) \u2013 in other words, that he and Hepzibah have killed Judge Pyncheon.<PARAGRAPH>The children run off in fright, but  they start daring each other to run past the House of the Seven Gables.<PARAGRAPH>They think they can see Clifford and Hepzibah scowling at them from the windows.<PARAGRAPH>Half an hour later, a cab stops at the door.<PARAGRAPH>It's Phoebe! She's back!<PARAGRAPH>Ned Higgins screams at her not to go inside.<PARAGRAPH>Ned Higgins thinks there's \"something wicked there!\" (19.57).<PARAGRAPH>The doors are locked, so Phoebe goes around to the garden.<PARAGRAPH>She sees that the storm has made Maule's well overflow.<PARAGRAPH>Phoebe starts to feel slightly nervous.<PARAGRAPH>The side door swings open and Phoebe walks inside.<PARAGRAPH>The door swings shut behind her.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200923164503/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/house-seven-gables/summary/chapter-19"}
