{"name": "Chapter 2", "summary": "Chapter Two. This chapter is set on the campus of the protagonist's college in the early 1930s. He marvels at the landscape and the wonderful aspects of nature on the campus. He describes the statue of the founder lifting the veil over the head of a slave and expresses that he can't tell if the veil is being lifted or lowered. The community and its local quirks are also described. Founder's Day is approaching and many have come to celebrate it, including trustees affiliated with the college. In order to assure their comfort, students are assigned jobs to assist them in their needs during their stay. The protagonist is assigned to be the driver for Mr. Norton, a wealthy white man who is one of the college's valued trustees. During the drive, Norton explains to the protagonist that he feels that the college and its students are his destiny. Because Norton finds the drive relaxing, he asks the protagonist to drive him around the town and during this time they encounter old slave quarters that some of the local citizens still inhabit. They pass by Jim Trueblood's home and the narrator tells Norton of the disgrace Trueblood has brought on his family because of his rape and subsequent impregnation of his daughter. Instantly, Norton wants to meet him. Trueblood tells the story of how because of the cold and lack of heat, he is forced to sleep next to his wife and daughter and that during a dream, he ultimately rapes her. Alarmed by the story, Norton is visibly shaken, gives Trueblood a $100 bill and immediately requests whiskey or some kind of stimulant in order to cope with what he has just heard", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201125173837/https://www.novelguide.com/invisible-man/summaries/chapters2-4"}
