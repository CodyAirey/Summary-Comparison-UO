{"name": "Chapter 12", "summary": "Dimmesdale goes to the scaffold where Hester Prynne had lived through her public ordeal.<PARAGRAPH>He stands there just waiting for someone to throw rotten fruit, but no one shows up.<PARAGRAPH><PARAGRAPH>He gives a little shriek, trying to rouse people to come shame him, but the only people who stir are Governor Bellingham and his sister.<PARAGRAPH>Mistress Hibbins  hears him, but the narrator tells us that she probably thinks that it's just her friendly neighborhood witches making a ruckus.<PARAGRAPH>Dimmesdale calms down enough to notice that his friend and fellow clergyman Reverend Mr. Wilson is approaching.<PARAGRAPH>He's coming from the deathbed of Governor Winthrop, looking all holy and saint-like with the glow of the lamp like a halo surrounding him.<PARAGRAPH>He doesn't notice Dimmesdale lurking up on the platform, and Dimmesdale doesn't speak.<PARAGRAPH>Dimmesdale imagines what would happen if he were still there in the morning, and he's apparently  tickled by imagining his community discovering that their beloved minister is a huge sinner because he busts out laughing.<PARAGRAPH>Surprise! Pearl laughs back at him.<PARAGRAPH>He calls out and Pearl responds. Hester is also with her. They're heading back from Governor Winthrop's house, where she's measured his body so she can make his burial robe.<PARAGRAPH>The two join him on the scaffold.<PARAGRAPH>Dimmesdale and Hester are connected through Pearl, as each holds one of her hands.<PARAGRAPH>Pearl asks him if he will stand with her and her mother tomorrow at noon.<PARAGRAPH>No--but he will stand with them on the judgment day.<PARAGRAPH>How comforting,<PARAGRAPH>Just then, there's a bright light on the horizon, which is either a meteor or a big, fat symbol.<PARAGRAPH>Also looking very symbolic right about now: the minister, with his hand over his heart; Hester Prynne, the scarlet letter on her heart; and Pearl, herself a symbol.<PARAGRAPH>Pearl grins a little and points, and Dimmesdale sees what looks like an immense letter A marked out in red light.<PARAGRAPH>And then he sees Roger Chillingworth, who Dimmesdale finally notices is looking kind of evil.<PARAGRAPH>Pearl and Dimmesdale have  a little squabble, which ends with Pearl basically telling them that he sucks for not promising to stand there with her and her mom.<PARAGRAPH>Just then, Chillingworth steps forward and gets Dimmesdale to come home with him.<PARAGRAPH>The next day, Dimmesdale gives  an A+ sermon. As he comes down the pulpit-steps, the sexton hands him a glove, his glove, which the sexton had found on the scaffolding.<PARAGRAPH>The sexton's theory? Satan must have dropped it there.<PARAGRAPH>By the way, the sexton says, did Dimmesdale see the letter A in the sky last night? It was a portent of the death of Governor Winthrop, surely now an Angel.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20211014221130/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/scarlet-letter/summary/chapter-12"}
