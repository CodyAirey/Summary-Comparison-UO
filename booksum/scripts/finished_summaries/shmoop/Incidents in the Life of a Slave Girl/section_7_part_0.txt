Lies, lies, and more lies. Slave owners lie to their slaves about how bad life is up North. Like, a slaveholder once told Linda that he saw one of her runaway friends up North, and she was literally dying of starvation. Gee, that's weird. Because Linda has actually stayed with that friend, who's totally happy with her new free life. Of course, now there's the Fugitive Slave Law, which makes it illegal for Northerners to help runaway slaves and offers rewards for their capture and return. So, Northerners, don't injure yourself by patting your own backs, there. As long as the North enforces this law, it's also guilty of slavery.", "analysis": ""}
