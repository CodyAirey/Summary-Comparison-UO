{"name": "Chapter Thirty-Three", "summary": "More of the Eltons:<PARAGRAPH>Emma notices that the Eltons  go out of their way to snub Harriet. This makes Emma hate them just a little bit more.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Elton takes a liking to Jane Fairfax. She tells Emma that \"we\" must bring her out into the world more.<PARAGRAPH>Emma wants no part of a \"we\" that includes Mrs. Elton. Or Jane Fairfax, for that matter.<PARAGRAPH>Nonetheless, she does pity Jane for the \"assistance\" that she's about to receive from Mrs. Elton.<PARAGRAPH>Even Emma can see that Jane is approximately 37 million times more of a gentlewoman than Mrs. Elton ever could be.<PARAGRAPH>Interestingly, soon after this visit Mrs. Elton grows suddenly cold towards Emma.<PARAGRAPH>As you can guess, Emma's rather OK with that.<PARAGRAPH>Emma wonders why Jane Fairfax is still staying with her aunts. It can't be too pleasant to stay with the Bateses - and now that Mrs. Elton's in the picture, Emma imagines that it must be insufferable.<PARAGRAPH>She talks Jane's situation over with Mrs. Weston when they next meet.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Weston suggests that perhaps Miss Bates unwittingly assisted Mrs. Elton's claim to \"protect\" Jane.<PARAGRAPH>Once her aunt asked for help, it might have been too hard for Jane to ask Mrs. Elton to leave her alone.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Knightley, who's also part of the conversation, agrees.<PARAGRAPH>Perhaps he was the one to send the piano to Jane?<PARAGRAPH>Proclaiming that sending a huge gift to a lover anonymously is the sort of thing that only a naive man would do, Mr. Knightley seems to clear himself of any such suspicions.<PARAGRAPH>Emma slyly asks Mr. Knightley if he likes Jane.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Knightley turns a bit red - but he declares that, although he thinks Jane is perfect, he's not in love with her.<PARAGRAPH>After he leaves, Mrs. Weston wonders aloud if Mr. Knightley doth protest too much.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210116113822/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/emma/summary/chapter-thirty-three"}
