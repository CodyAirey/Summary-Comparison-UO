Milady replies that it would be pointless.<PARAGRAPH>Milady continues to complain, and Felton threatens to fetch Lord de Winter.<PARAGRAPH>Felton brings a book containing a Catholic mass for Milady.<PARAGRAPH>She detects that Felton is not a Catholic, and that this can be used to her advantage. She rapidly pretends to be a Puritan without actually telling Felton this fact straight out.<PARAGRAPH>Lord de Winter later visits her and makes fun of her religious conversion.<PARAGRAPH>Felton overhears the entire conversation. Later that evening, Milady prays aloud. An old servant of hers was a Puritan; Milady co-opts the prayers for her own ends. She pretends to be in a religious ecstasy as Felton orders the dinner table brought in. She finishes her prayers and eats only a little.<PARAGRAPH>The table is cleared out and Milady notes with joy that Felton does not accompany them\u2014clearly he is afraid of seeing her too often.<PARAGRAPH>She begins to sing pure Puritan verses. Her voice is incredible and is heard throughout the castle.<PARAGRAPH>It is clear Felton has been moved. He goes to visit her room and believes he sees an angel.
