{"name": "Chapter 78", "summary": "Chapter 78 Summary Will looks at Rosamond angrily, who by throwing herself at him in her misery, ended all his long-held hopes. He lashes out at her, oblivious to her hurt and shock. She feels his remark about Dorothea \"No other woman exists by the side of her\" to be a \"poisoned weapon\" hurled at her. For the first time, she is made to feel the strong emotions of another person beside herself. After his forceful outburst, Will is unable to make polite remarks and walks out, after saying he will call on Lydgate. When Lydgate returns, he finds her pathetic and ill in bed. He assumes that Dorotheas visit has stirred her emotionally and made her turn towards him. Notes Both women are shaken by the incident with Will. Rosamond is forced to see herself as irrelevant in Wills life and her fantasy is shattered. Her suffering inspires no tender sympathy in Will as it does in Lydgate. In her wounded state, she turns towards her husband.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820035130/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmMiddle91.asp"}
