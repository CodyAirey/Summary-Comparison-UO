{"name": "Chapter 1", "summary": "Our story opens with a view of Darwinist forces amassed against those of the great Austro-Hungarian Empire.<PARAGRAPH>Then we find out that those forces are Prince Aleksander's desk accessories set up for a mock battle--and here we thought decorating our lockers was cool.<PARAGRAPH>Prince Aleksander is having to make do with pens and ink bottles because his parents left him at home while they went to watch military maneuvers. Weak.<PARAGRAPH>But wait... Prince Aleksander hears noises in the hall and sneaks back to his bed to pretend to be asleep. Is it an assassin? A thief?<PARAGRAPH>Nope, it's just Otto Klopp, his master of mechaniks, and Count Volger, his fencing master.<PARAGRAPH>The two men tell Prince Aleksander to come with them for some nighttime training exercises in his walker, which is not something little babies and old people use, but a sweet war machine.<PARAGRAPH>They all sneak out of the palace--something we at Shmoop do all the time .<PARAGRAPH>As they're getting their sneak on, Alek  reflects on his position: because his mother isn't royal, his parents' marriage doesn't count. This means that Alek will never be able to inherit his father's lands and titles unless he defies his great-uncle, the emperor. First world problems, right?<PARAGRAPH>Oh, and Volger, as a noble, doesn't really respect Alek the way commoners like Klopp do.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210507031130/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/leviathan/summary/chapter-1"}
