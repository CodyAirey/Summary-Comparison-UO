Upon his entry, Ragueneau is distracted from the paper bags covered with verse. He praises Cyrano for his duel that was fought while composing a ballad. Cyrano asks Ragueneau to let him use the shop as a private meeting place. The baker agrees to the plan reluctantly, for it is the hour when his poets usually arrive. While waiting nervously for Roxane, Cyrano writes a love letter to give to Roxane, while Lise entertains a musketeer who has entered the shop. Notes In this scene, the kindness and generosity of Ragueneau are highlighted. Cyrano arrives at his bakery and asks Ragueneau if he can use the shop as a private meeting place.
