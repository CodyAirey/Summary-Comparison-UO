(Apparently, Windsor is just like junior high school, only with marriages instead of mash notes.)<PARAGRAPH>We find out that Mistress Quickly is the servant of a guy named Doctor Caius and lives at his house.<PARAGRAPH>Then Evans decides to let us in on a little gossip: apparently, Mistress Quickly doesn't just do Doctor Caius's laundry and cooking.<PARAGRAPH>She's also his \"oman\" (that's how Evans says \"woman\" with his thick Welsh accent). In other words, Mistress Quickly is probably sleeping with her boss.<PARAGRAPH>Brain Snack: In Henry IV Part 1, Mistress Quickly isn't a servant\u2014she's the hostess of the Boar's Head Tavern, which is the kind of seedy bar where criminals and prostitutes hang out. Since The Merry Wives of Windsor is basically a spin-off of Henry IV Part 1, Shakespeare would have expected his audience to know all about Mistress Quickly's shady ways.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20211017012900/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/merry-wives-of-windsor/summary/act-1-scene-2"}
