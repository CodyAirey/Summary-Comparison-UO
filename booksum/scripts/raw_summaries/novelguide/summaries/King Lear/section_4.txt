Lear asks his messenger who put him in the stocks, and he is informed it was his own son and daughter.  At first he does not believe, but then he becomes extremely insulted.  Gloucester enters, and Lear demands to speak with Regan and Cornwall.  Gloucester tells him that they cannot see him right away, and he becomes angrier demanding they attend him.  When they come, they release Kent and Lear tells them not to believe the messages from Goneril.  Regan, however, refuses to house him and tells him to go back to her sister and apologize.  Lear tells her of the grave injustice that her sister has afflicted on him by cutting him off from his men, but she only replies by telling him that Goneril is also traveling to Gloucester.  When she arrives the two sisters team up against their father and tell him that he may stay with them, but have none of his men.  He, in a rage, leaves the castle into a storm.  The women tell Gloucester to shut the castle against their father so he is caught out in the storm. \n\tAct 3, Scene 1: Kent runs into Lear's Gentleman who tells him what is going on.
