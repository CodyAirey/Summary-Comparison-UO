It's kind of funny that Deryn is so shocked, right?<PARAGRAPH>The woman introduces herself as Dr. Barlow.<PARAGRAPH>Deryn sees two younger scientists carrying a carefully packed crate between them: mysterious cargo.<PARAGRAPH>Dr. Barlow brings out a dogesque beast, whom she introduces as Tazza, her pet. He's a Tasmanian tiger, and is a natural animal, not fabricated.<PARAGRAPH>Deryn leads Dr. Barlow, the two younger scientists, and Tazza to the Leviathan, which Dr. Barlow says doesn't look happy\u2014Deryn can see that the Leviathan is upset, but she assures Dr. Barlow it's just because it's so near the ground.<PARAGRAPH>Deryn begins to explain the Leviathan to Dr. Barlow. As it turns out though, Dr. Barlow fabricated this species of airship, so Deryn feels pretty dumb.<PARAGRAPH>Deryn notices that many of the ground men seem untrained, which is a big problem that could get a lot of people killed\u2014so Dr. Barlow uses her message parrot (because of course) to send a message from Deryn to the captain about this.<PARAGRAPH>Deryn and Dr. Barlow observe the tactics the captain uses to get the untrained men to let go.<PARAGRAPH>When Dr. Barlow compliments her, Deryn asks the scientist to put in a good word with the captain due to the weight issue.<PARAGRAPH>This goes a bit south when Dr. Barlow says she and Tazza would love a cabin boy of their very own\u2014Deryn's not excited at this prospect.<PARAGRAPH>She's also not excited by the prospect of another woman on board\u2014another woman who might notice things men wouldn't.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210507031130/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/leviathan/summary/chapter-16"}
