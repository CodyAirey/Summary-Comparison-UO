{"name": "chapter 14", "summary": "The narrator returns to Mary's house and smells cabbage cooking. The smell reminds the narrator of poverty, and he is \nfilled with remorse for the expense he has caused Mary. He realizes he should have accepted Brother Jack\u2019s job offer so \nhe could pay her. Mary has been kind to him, and he has repaid her by creating more debt. He pulls out Brother Jack\u2019s \nnumber and calls.<PARAGRAPH>In moments, a car arrives for the narrator. Jack and several other men are in the car. They take the narrator to a house \nwhere a party is evidently taking place. A woman opens the door and invites them inside. Another woman named Emma \nserves them a drink. Jack and Emma discuss the narrator as a hero of the people. Moments later the narrator overhears \nEmma questioning Jack as to whether he thinks the new speaker should be \"blacker.\" Jack reminds her that they are \nconcerned with his voice and not his looks. The narrator is angered by what he has overheard. He walks over to a \nwindow and looks down at the street, wondering what the woman wants from him. Brother Jack approaches him at the \nwindow and asks him to join in a meeting in the library.<PARAGRAPH>The narrator is told the organization has been formed to work for a better world. Jack asks him if he wants to be the next \nBooker T. Washington. The narrator does not know how to respond. He does, however, ask when he should begin work. \nThey tell him to show up the next day. They also inform him to leave Mary's house and stop writing home, for he must \nbecome very private. In addition, he is handed a paper with a name written on it that is to be his new identity; he is told to \nanswer only to his new name in the future. They give him money to pay his debt at Mary's and tell him that they will pay \nhim a salary of sixty dollars per week. He can hardly believe his good fortune.<PARAGRAPH>Back in the main room of the social gathering, a man calls the narrator, asking \n        him to sing a gospel. Brother Jack snaps at the man and tells him that \n        he does not sing. The narrator laughs out of control, until others in \n        the room break the tension with laughter as well. A woman then apologizes \n        for the drunken man's behavior. He feels confused as to why everyone thought \n        the man was wrong to ask him to sing. His thoughts are interrupted when \n        Emma asks him to dance. He goes to the dance floor with her as if he is \n        not surprised to be dancing with a white woman; but his mind is racing \n        with the implications and the newness of the situation. Later, at Mary's \n        house, he realizes he cannot face her to tell her he is leaving her. He \n        decides to simply disappear; since he has a new identity, he will leave \n        everything old behind.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025232/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Invisible_Man_Ellison/Invisible_Man_Study_Guide14.html"}
