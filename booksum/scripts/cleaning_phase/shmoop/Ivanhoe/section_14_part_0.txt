{"name": "Chapter 14", "summary": "Before this chapter we get the first six lines of Thomas Warton's 1787 poem \"Ode XVIII to a New Year.\" Like all the other recent chapter epigraphs, this one is also a medieval-themed poem about knights and ladies gathering together. In this case, they are meeting up at a great hall. It's time for a feast.<PARAGRAPH>Prince John holds his feast at the castle at Ashby.<PARAGRAPH><PARAGRAPH>The real owner of the castle is in the Holy Land, so Prince John feels free to use it as though it's his own.<PARAGRAPH>The prince doesn't want to offend the Anglo-Saxons because there are so many of them.<PARAGRAPH>He plans to host Cedric and Athelstane in better style than they have ever seen before.<PARAGRAPH>It's unfortunate that Prince John always offends people when he most wants to please them.<PARAGRAPH>After the feast, talk turns to the tournament.<PARAGRAPH>Prince John proposes a toast to Wilfred of Ivanhoe, the tournament winner.<PARAGRAPH>Cedric starts going off on his disobedient son, who went off to the Crusades with Norman King Richard against the orders of his own father.<PARAGRAPH>Prince John pounces on Cedric's anger at his son.<PARAGRAPH>He turns to Reginald Front-de-Boeuf and says: Well, Front-de-Boeuf, why don't you keep Ivanhoe's castle and lands so poor Cedric doesn't have to see his ungrateful son in the neighborhood?<PARAGRAPH>Front-de-Boeuf happily agrees: he wasn't going to give the castle back to a Saxon anyway.<PARAGRAPH>This inspires a whole round of anti-Saxon jokes that really set Cedric's blood boiling.<PARAGRAPH>Cedric accuses Prince John of being a poor host and points out that a Saxon won the tournament that day.<PARAGRAPH>Prince John drinks a toast to Cedric, but Cedric is still riled.<PARAGRAPH>Prince John asks Cedric to pick at least one worthy Norman for them to drink to.<PARAGRAPH>Prince John's advisor, Waldemar Fitzurse, whispers to Cedric that he should choose Prince John.<PARAGRAPH>But Cedric declares that he will drink to King Richard I, \"the best and noblest of his race\" .<PARAGRAPH>Prince John is clearly not pleased at this toast, though he doesn't protest aloud.<PARAGRAPH>Cedric and Athelstane leave.<PARAGRAPH>Prince John notices that his other guests leave soon after the Saxons.<PARAGRAPH>Prince John worries that the Normans see him as weak and that this confrontation at his own feast has led them to lose confidence in him.<PARAGRAPH>De Bracy and Waldemar Fitzurse promise to convince the Normans to support Prince John.<PARAGRAPH>Fitzurse worries that Prince John is losing hope in his own rebellion.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210614173333/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/ivanhoe/summary/chapter-14"}
