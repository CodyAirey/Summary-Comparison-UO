{"name": "Chapter 10", "summary": "The Assistant Commissioner rides in a cab back to the parliament building. When he arrives, he runs into Toodles. Toodles is very surprised to find that the A.C. has returned so quickly, and assumes that something must have gone wrong with the investigation.<PARAGRAPH>He lets the A.C. in to see Ethelred, who is still waiting around. As they walk toward the office, Toodles asks the A.C. if he's captured the man he's looking for.<PARAGRAPH>The A.C. says yes, and tells Toodles that an honorary member of the exclusive Explorers' Club has been involved with the Greenwich bombing.  Toodles is shocked, being someone who assumes that high-society folk could never get mixed up with crime.<PARAGRAPH>He's actually morally offended, and preserves \"a scandalized and solemn silence\" (10.24) after the A.C. tells him this.<PARAGRAPH>The A.C. goes into Ethelred's office and recounts how he got a full confession out of Verloc. He says that Michaelis had nothing at all to do with Greenwich. Both Ethelred and the A.C. find it weird that Verloc would take such desperate actions because of Mr. Vladimir, but they don't fully understand Verloc's commitment to laziness, and his fear and anger at having his laziness threatened.<PARAGRAPH>The A.C. then muses about the man who blew himself up, who he confirms to be Verloc's brother-in-law, Stevie. He doesn't know how Stevie could've gotten away with the crime even if he'd lived, but the narrator tells us that the A.C. doesn't realize how loyal Stevie was to Verloc.<PARAGRAPH>After this meeting, the A.C. travels home for a moment, then goes out to meet his wife at the home of \"the great lady patroness of Michaelis\" (10.59). When he gets there, he sees the lady patroness sitting with two people, one man and one woman.<PARAGRAPH>At this point, the woman introduces the A.C. to the man sitting at the foot of her couch, who turns out to be Mr. Vladimir.  Mr. Vladimir has supposedly been \"frightening\" the old woman with horror stories about left-wing radicals, trying to spread fear about them in the wake of the Greenwich Park incident.<PARAGRAPH>Realizing who Mr. Vladimir is, the A.C. now can't resist saying, \"I've no doubt that Mr. Vladimir has a very precise notion of the true importance of this affair\" (10.76). This sets Vladimir's thoughts churning, and he instantly wonders what the A.C. could mean by this comment.<PARAGRAPH>This is exactly what the A.C. wanted to provoke, since he knows from Verloc about Vladimir's involvement with the whole Greenwich affair.<PARAGRAPH>Vladimir responds that yes, his job has made him very familiar with radicals and their tactics. He tries to dig at the A.C. by saying that he wouldn't have to know so much if the English police knew their business and were a little more aggressive. After this, he gets up to leave, but the A.C. follows him.<PARAGRAPH>Once outside, the A.C. tells Vladimir that Verloc has exposed the connection between the Embassy, and the business in Greenwich Park. Vladimir says no one will ever believe Verloc, but the A.C. assures him that Verloc's knowledge of specific details will definitely convince the public.<PARAGRAPH>Vladimir starts to feel sick. The A.C. says that his favorite aspect of the whole case is that it will be the starting point for his crusade to banish all foreign agents and their bosses from England. \"the clearing of this country of all the foreign political spies, police, and that sort of\u2014 of\u2014 dogs\" (10.96).<PARAGRAPH>Vladimir asks if the A.C. truly means to take everything public, and the A.C. says he has no choice, since Verloc wants to reveal everything in court.<PARAGRAPH>Vladimir raises his hand for a cab. The A.C. tells him he (Vladimir) can't get in, but Vladimir gets in anyway and drives away. The A.C. looks across the street to the face of the Explorers' Club, where he knows he won't be seeing Mr. Vladimir in the future. As far as England goes, Mr. Vladimir and all of his cronies are done.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219185957/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/the-secret-agent/summary/chapter-10"}
