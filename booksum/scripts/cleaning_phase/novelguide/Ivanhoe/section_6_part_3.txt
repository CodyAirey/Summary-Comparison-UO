{"name": "Chapter XXIV", "summary": "Chapter XXIV. Rebecca is thrust into a cell where she encounters an old woman named Urfried. It turns out that when Urfried was young, Front-de-Boeuf's father stormed the castle in which her father and his seven sons lived. All the men were killed, and Urfried was forced to live in the castle with the conquerors. She tells Rebecca there is no escape, and leaves the cell. De Bois-Guilbert comes to the cell and makes it clear that he wishes to possess her. Rebecca reproaches him, but he tells her that she is his captive and subject to his will. He asks her to submit to her fate and become a Christian, a proposal which horrifies her. She opens the window and stands on the parapet, threatening to jump. De Bois-Guilbert promises he will not hurt her in any way. Reluctantly, she decides to trust him and steps down from the parapet. He says she does him an injustice and he is genuinely devoted to her. But he adds that the union must be with her consent and on her terms. He tells her that he has ambitions to become the powerful Grand Master of the Templars, but he is cynical about the chivalric and spiritual ideals of the Order. He simply seeks power, and implies that Rebecca will be able to share it, and that this will be good for the Jews. Then he hears the bugle sound from outside the castle and leaves the cell, promising Rebecca he will return.
