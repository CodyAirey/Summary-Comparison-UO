Only the best and bravest for the British Air Service.<PARAGRAPH>The first intimidation factor comes from lupine tigeresques\u2014yes, gigantic wolf tigers. We're not sure we would make it, but Deryn does. A bunch of other recruits don't stop running until they're out of there, though, which seems like a perfectly appropriate response to us.<PARAGRAPH>The next intimidation factor comes from another beastie: this time, it's a giant jellyfish thing, otherwise known as a Huxley ascender, a jellyfish that works like a giant balloon.<PARAGRAPH>The thought of going up in that thing thins the ranks even further, but when the flight captain asks for volunteers, Deryn steps up.<PARAGRAPH>After buckling into the harness, Deryn rises over London in the Huxley.<PARAGRAPH>At first, she's having a great time, but then the Huxley starts getting nervous, and Deryn sees why: a storm is coming.<PARAGRAPH>She doesn't want to throw out her panic flag for fear of losing face, but she knows she needs to get out of the air before that storm arrives.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210507031130/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/leviathan/summary/chapter-4"}
