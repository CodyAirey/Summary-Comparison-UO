{"name": "Act III", "summary": "Act III opens in the same room at the Tesmans\u2019 house. (Ibsen must have been on a set budget. Either that, or this is social commentary. See \"Setting\" and find out.) The doorway to the inner room at the back of the stage is covered by curtains. The light is low, as the curtains are also drawn over the glass doors on the left of the stage. The fire is nearly burnt out. Hedda, still dressed, is passed out on the sofa sleeping, and Mrs. Elvsted is sitting awake, still waiting for Eilert to come back and escort her home.<PARAGRAPH>Berta enters with a letter for George left by Aunt Julie\u2019s maid.<PARAGRAPH>Berta not-so-comfortingly tells Mrs. Elvsted that it\u2019s daybreak, no men have come back, and one could hardly have expected anything less from a drunkard like Eilert.<PARAGRAPH>Hedda wakes up, having slept \"quite well.\" She doesn\u2019t seem concerned at all. She guesses that the men got drunk and stayed over at Brack\u2019s place, and tells Thea to go lie down in the bedroom, promising to wake her if anyone arrives.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Elvsted exits. Hedda goes to the glass door leading to the patio and opens the curtains, allowing the light in. Then she tells Berta to build up the fire, but takes over the job herself when the doorbell rings.<PARAGRAPH>George enters. He asks if Hedda was worried about him.<PARAGRAPH>She was not.<PARAGRAPH>Tesman explains that Eilert read some of his new manuscript aloud at the party, and it was absolutely amazing. George admits to being a bit jealous of his colleague.<PARAGRAPH>He explains that, despite what every one has said, Eilert isn\u2019t able to be reformed. Hedda thinks this means Eilert has more courage, but Tesman interprets it as Eilert being a drunk. (Less poetical; more realistic.) He adds that the night ended in a sort of orgy.<PARAGRAPH>Hedda, apparently unperturbed by the orgy comment, asks her husband if there were vine leaves in Eilert\u2019s hair. No, says George, but he did give a long speech about the woman who inspired his work (that would be Mrs. Elvsted, though Eilert never explicitly named his muse).<PARAGRAPH>Then George takes something out of his pocket \u2013 Eilert\u2019s manuscript. It seems that Eilert dropped it in the street in the midst of all his drunken debauchery. George hasn\u2019t told anyone about finding it, not even Eilert, as he figures his friend would be embarrassed about his carelessness.<PARAGRAPH>Hedda pointedly asks if the work could ever be re-written, and at hearing \"probably not\" insists that George give it to her \u2013 you know, so she can harmlessly look it over for a bit. He (wisely) hesitates.<PARAGRAPH>George then opens the letter from Aunt Julie; he is alarmed to discover that Aunt Rina is dying. While he readies himself to rush over, Hedda takes advantage of the situation to procure the manuscript.<PARAGRAPH>Meanwhile Brack has arrived; George rushes out and Hedda is left to entertain the Judge.<PARAGRAPH>Hedda gets right to pumping the Judge for information about last night\u2019s activities. He divulges everything: Eilert got drunk and ended up at Mademoiselle Diana\u2019s \"parlors.\" This Diana lady is a red-headed \"singer\" \u2013 sound familiar?<PARAGRAPH>The Judge continues his narrative. When they first arrived, Diana welcomed Eilert back with open arms. But there was a row at the end of the night, when he accused her friends of having stolen something from him.<PARAGRAPH>It got so bad that the police showed up, and a very drunk and irate Eilert hit one of the officers and was arrested.<PARAGRAPH>Brack has heard this all second hand, from the police \u2013 he wasn\u2019t there himself.<PARAGRAPH>Hedda is again disappointed to hear that Eilert had no vine leaves in his hair.<PARAGRAPH>Then Brack gets a bit crafty. Eilert is part of a scandal now, and no \"decent\" families will allow him in their houses anymore. He advises that Hedda and George do the same thing.<PARAGRAPH>Hedda cuts right through the b.s. \u2013 Brack doesn\u2019t want any competition for the third leg of the triangle he\u2019s so keen on forming with Hedda and her husband. The Judge admits that this is true.<PARAGRAPH>Hedda declares that, when he\u2019s in a tight corner, the Judge is a dangerous man. She\u2019s glad he doesn\u2019t have any kind of hold over her\u2026 (uh-oh.)<PARAGRAPH>They make with the witty banter for a few more lines and the Judge exits. Now alone, Hedda pulls out Eilert\u2019s manuscript and begins flipping through it. When she hears voices approaching, she locks it in her writing desk.<PARAGRAPH>Eilert busts into the room, apologizing for his lateness and wondering what Hedda has heard about last night. She admits to hearing about his inappropriate escapades.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Elvsted hears Eilert and comes bursting out of the bedroom. She doesn\u2019t want to hear anything about last night \u2013 she\u2019s just happy he\u2019s back now \u2013 but Eilert insists on talking to her: they need to separate from each other, he says to Thea, because he has \"no more use\" for her.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Elvsted, not exactly the pillar of feminist pride, pleads with him not to leave her and insists she be with him when the new book is published. Eilert agrees that it is \"their\" book, together, and then confesses: he tore the manuscript into a thousand pieces.<PARAGRAPH>Sure, why not, Eilert continues \u2013 he tore his life up now that he\u2019s gone back to drinking, so why not destroy his life\u2019s work as well?<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Elvsted is horrified \u2013 it seems to her as though he has killed their child. She leaves.<PARAGRAPH>Eilert turns to Hedda and tries to explain his feelings. He knows that last night won\u2019t mark the end of his debauchery, but he\u2019s also not that into the wild life anymore. Mrs. Elvsted broke that in him, he says.<PARAGRAPH>Hedda is in awe that a woman like Thea could have such power over a man like Eilert. Then she calls him heartless for having treated Mrs. Elvsted that way.<PARAGRAPH>This prompts Eilert to confess \u2013 he didn\u2019t actually destroy the manuscript. He lost it, which he thinks is worse than tearing it up. He makes Hedda promise not to tell Thea.<PARAGRAPH>Anyway, that\u2019s why he\u2019s ending things with Thea. He\u2019s lost their \"child\" \u2013 her \"pure soul\" \u2013 and he can\u2019t expect a future with her now. Now he just wants to \"put an end to it all.\"<PARAGRAPH>Hedda gets that he\u2019s talking about suicide and jumps at the opportunity to entertain herself. She provides Eilert with one of her pistols (which she keeps stored in the drawer of her writing desk) and tells him to do it \"beautifully,\" even though she \"doesn\u2019t believe in vine leaves anymore.\"<PARAGRAPH>(Shmoopers \u2013 if you\u2019re confused here, check out \"Symbols, Imagery, Allegory\" for a discussion of this vine leaves business.)<PARAGRAPH>Eilert takes the pistol and leaves, with a final \"Good-bye, Hedda Gabler\" marking his exit.<PARAGRAPH>After he leaves, Hedda takes out the hidden manuscript and promptly burns it in the fireplace, while maniacally ranting: \"Now I\u2019m burning your child, Thea!\" over and over.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210730163709/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/hedda-gabler/summary/act-iii"}
