{"name": "chapter 11", "summary": "On his way back to Ashby, poor Gurth is attacked by four men who steal \n        the money he carries, both his gold coins and that belonging to Ivanhoe. \n        The thieves question him about where he got the money. When Gurth tells \n        about Rebecca\u0092s kindness, the thieves refuse to believe that any Jew would \n        return a payment on a loan. Gurth fights with his attackers. When he shows \n        his courage in the conflict, the robbers surprisingly give him back his \n        money and escort him to Ashby.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025232/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Ivanhoe_Sir_Walter_Scott/Ivanhoe_Study_Guide10.html"}
