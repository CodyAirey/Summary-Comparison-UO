{"name": "volume 3, Chapter 46", "summary": "Chapter 46: About ten days after Mrs. Churchill's death, Mr. Weston comes to Hartfield to ask Emma to return home with him, as Mrs. Weston wants to see her. He seems quite serious, and Emma is concerned that something horrible has happened. When she gets there Mrs. Weston tells her that Frank had just been there and had told them that he and Jane are engaged, and have been since October. Emma is shocked and tries to remember everything that she said to Frank about Jane. They are both disillusioned about how Frank could have been engaged to Jane since before either of them had come to Hartfield and that they would hide it so long. Mrs. Weston fears that Emma may have been mislead, and Emma assures her that she is not in love with him. She continues on to say that this should not excuse him though, since he obviously was trying to make it look like she was the object of his affections, and she could have been badly hurt. Emma also does not understand how Jane could watch his attentions to her and say nothing, and Mrs. Weston says that Frank said that there were misunderstandings between them. The couple could not marry with Mrs. Churchill alive, as she would not approve the match. As soon as she died and Frank heard about Jane's plans to take a position, he talked Mr. Churchill into approving the match and came quickly to his father to have him approve it. Emma is quite upset that they had been duped the whole time. Mr. and Mrs. Weston are quite relived that Emma will not have any pain over the marriage as they were quite concerned and had wished for a match to be made between them", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210421073237/http://www.novelguide.com/emma/summaries/chap46-48"}
