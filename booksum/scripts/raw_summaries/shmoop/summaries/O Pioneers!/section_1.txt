{"name": "Part 1, Chapter 2", "summary": "The narrator tells us some more about the Bergson homestead. Not exactly home sweet home, here\u2014John Bergson, the father of Alexandra andEmil, has been toiling away in this wasteland for 11 years, without much to\nshow for it. Plain and simple, the prairie land is \"unfriendly to man\"\n(1.2.2).<PARAGRAPH>Old man Bergson is on his deathbed, recounting all the\nhardships he's experienced in Nebraska. Only 46 years old and having just\nrecently paid off his debts, his life is about to end. Like the rest of the\nfarmers on the prairie, John's not a farmer by trade, but had a different job\nback in the Old World. He used to work in a shipyard. These aren't people who\nknow a whole lot about farming, and let's face it: the prairie is no place for\namateurs.<PARAGRAPH>John thinks about his daughter, Alexandra, and his two older\nsons, Lou and Oscar. Alexandra is the one who knows what's up on the farm, the\none he's always been able to count on; she's smart. His two boys are\nhardworking, but dim-witted.<PARAGRAPH>Alexandra reminds him of his own father, a shipbuilder in\nStockholm. He was a smart man who amassed a fortune in his lifetime, before\nsquandering it all on his much younger, second wife.<PARAGRAPH>Then again, John would prefer to have a son who reflected some\nof his father's qualities. But he is happy to know that Alexandra will continue\nhis hard work.<PARAGRAPH>John calls for his daughter in Swedish. He tells her in so\nmany words that all the responsibility for the farm will fall on her when he's\ngone. He tells her never to abandon the land, no matter how bad things get.<PARAGRAPH>Lou and Oscar come in to see their father, too. John tells\nthem to avoid fighting with each other and to listen to their sister, the\neldest child. He tells them that the land will be divided fairly, according to\nthe law, when they decide to marry.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, he tells them to hire a man to work the fields, so\nAlexandra can tend to her butter and eggs. And he tells them not to begrudge\ntheir mother her garden and fruit trees, which she plants to remind herself of\nthe old country.<PARAGRAPH>The narrator turns to John Bergson's wife. Mrs. Bergson is\nlower class than her husband, John. She's a \"corpulent woman, heavy and\nplacid,\" who longs for Sweden, having never forgiven her husband for\nbringing her all the way to Nebraska. She insisted on living in a log house,\ninstead of the sod houses most of their neighbors built.<PARAGRAPH>She tends to look down on other women, while they think she's\nproud. When she's not thinking about the homeland, she's preserving and\npickling everything she can find.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219131311/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/o-pioneers/summary/part-1-chapter-2"}
