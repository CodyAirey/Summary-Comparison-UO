Henry and Katharine did produce a son, Henry the Sixth, whose story is told in other plays.", "analysis": "The Chorus in the Epilogue simply reminds the audience once again that the stage has not been adequate for the subject matter, but then no stage could be large enough for an adequate presentation of the man who is the ideal king, the mirror of all Christian kings."}
