Messages \n        in a similar vein from Lady Catherine are also included.

He appears \n        unruffled as ever but tells Elizabeth that he is to blame for being lenient \n        with Lydia. He resolves, in his ironic manner, to be more strict with \n        Kitty.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025227/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Pride_And_Prejudice_Austen/Pride_And_Prejudice_Study_Guide22.html"}
