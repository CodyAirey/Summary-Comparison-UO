{"name": "Book 9, Chapter 7", "summary": "Dmitri confesses his terrible secret, which is that the money is actually the money he stole from Katerina. <PARAGRAPH>On his first spree with Grushenka a month ago, he had only spent 1,500 roubles, not 3,000, as legend had it. He had saved the other half of the money, sewn up in a bit of cloth and hung like an \"amulet\" around his neck before he had left for Mokroye, thinking he might need money to marry Grushenka if she accepted him.<PARAGRAPH>The prosecutor and the district attorney are skeptical. They ask him where the cloth is, and Dmitri doesn't know exactly - he just remembers tearing it up in the town square. They ask him where he got the cloth, and he guesses that he might have stolen his landlady's bonnet.<PARAGRAPH>By this point, Dmitri realizes that he is lost. After a short break, they decide to proceed to interrogate the witnesses.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210619150344/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/brothers-karamazov/summary/book-9-chapter-7"}
