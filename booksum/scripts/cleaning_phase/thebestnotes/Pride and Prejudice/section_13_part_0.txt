{"name": "chapter 16", "summary": "The following evening, the Bennet girls, Mr. Collins, and Wickham assemble at Mrs. Philips house. Collins finds an \nearnest listener in Mrs. Philips and rambles on about Lady Catherine and her grandiose mansion.<PARAGRAPH>Wickham seats himself next to Elizabeth, and the two start conversing. Wickham \n        tells her that he has been connected to Darcys family from infancy. Darcys \n        late father, an excellent man, had bequeathed him a good part of his estate, \n        but Darcy had treated him scandalously. Disregarding his fathers wishes, \n        he gave away Wickhams share to someone else. This act of backstabbing, \n        Wickham says, compelled him to join the army, although he was brought \n        up to take a role in the Church. When Elizabeth asks Wickham about Darcys \n        sister, he replies that she is as proud as Darcy; she is now sixteen years \n        old and is highly accomplished. He also reveals that Lady Catherine \n        is Darcys aunt, and it is believed that Darcy will marry her daughter \n        and, thereby, unite the two estates. Elizabeth returns home with her mind \n        full of Wickham and what he has told her. She wonders how a sweet-tempered \n        man like Bingley could take for a friend a disagreeable man like Darcy.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025227/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Pride_And_Prejudice_Austen/Pride_And_Prejudice_Study_Guide12.html"}
