{"name": "chapter xxiv", "summary": "The next morning, Julian West tries to find Edith alone, but does not \n        see her inside the house. He goes outside to find her and decides to visit \n        the underground chamber again. He notices some newspapers from his time \n        on a table and brings them up for Doctor Leete. At breakfast, he sees \n        Edith, who blushes, but is otherwise calm. Doctor Leete reads aloud some \n        of the articles of the paper, most of which are about labor strikes. Doctor \n        Leete claims that the anarchists were paid by the capitalists in order \n        to prevent progress from happening. Julian West notes that this is not \n        true, but that the presumption makes sense because of the fact that no \n        party could gain a hearing without getting a majority. Julian West wonders \n        if there was eventually a Labor Party. Doctor Leete says the Labor Party\u0092s \n        concerns were too narrow, but that another party, the National Party, \n        came along and succeeded in including everyone: all classes, all education \n        levels, men and women, old and young. Doctor Leete obviously feels a great \n        debt to the National Party\u0092s progressive thinking.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025235/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Looking_Backward_Bellamy/Looking_Backward_Study_Guide17.html"}
