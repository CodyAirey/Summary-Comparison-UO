He was French. He was well-off. He was cool. Everybody loved Charlemont, and Charlemont loved everybody. Then one day something happened. Nobody knows what happened, but all of a sudden, out of the blue, without warning, Charlemont...stopped...loving...people. Oh, no. Charlemont ditched all his casual friends, and he straight-up burned all his bridges with his good friends. Charlemont disappeared. Some said Charlemont went into debt. Then, just as randomly as before, Charlemont was back. Charlemont made up with everybody and bought them gifts, and they all loved him again. No one ever asked what happened when he went all emo. Until... One day... When... The last guest at one of Charlemont's parties worked up the nerve, after drinking a lot of wine, to ask: What's your damage, Heather? Charlemont got quiet. He called for more wine but gave a mystifying response basically amounting to: You wouldn't get it. You weren't there. Charlemont's guest then just left, knowing that even if his outside was happy, Charlemont still had some dark stuff going on inside.", "analysis": ""}
