In Shakespeare, the duped party is usually a guy, like Bertram in All's Well That Ends Well.<PARAGRAPH>The Duke explains that Marianna's actions won't be counted as a sin or a crime because Angelo is her \"husband on a pre-contract,\" meaning, they were formally betrothed before Angelo backed out of the wedding at the last minute.<PARAGRAPH>Everybody runs off to put the sneaky plan into action.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210615141326/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/measure-for-measure/summary/act-4-scene-1"}
