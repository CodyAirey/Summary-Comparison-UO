{"name": "Chapter 4", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210623094503/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/invisible-man-wells/summary/chapter-4", "summary": "The narrator tells us that, after the dog incident, not much happens in Iping until the club festival . Instead, the village settles into something of a routine. This is the routine: when Mrs. Hall complains about his messes, the stranger tells her to bill him extra, which works fine until April, when he starts to run out of money. No one in Iping really likes the stranger and everyone has a theory about why he's so weird. Some people think he's a criminal or an anarchist or a lunatic or simply a freak who could make a fortune charging people at county fairs to check him out. Whatever his deal is, everyone seems to agree that the stranger is too irritable for a village, \"though might have been comprehensible to an urban brain-worker\" . One villager who does want to talk to him is the town doctor, Cuss. On Whit Sunday, Cuss goes to talk to the stranger - partly because he's curious, partly because he's jealous of all his bottles. After the talk , Cuss runs out to see Bunting, the vicar. Cuss wanted gossip, but this is apparently what happened instead: while the stranger was telling him a story about why his research was taking so long , the stranger revealed that his sleeve was empty. Then he seemed to use an invisible hand to tweak Cuss' nose. To be clear, if you're trying to hide the fact that you're invisible, tweaking people's noses with your invisible hand is not a good strategy.", "analysis": ""}
