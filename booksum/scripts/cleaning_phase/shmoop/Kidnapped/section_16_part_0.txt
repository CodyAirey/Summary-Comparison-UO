{"name": "Chapter 17", "summary": "Henderland arranges for one of his parishioners, a fisherman, to take Davie by boat to Linnhe Loch in the country of Appin, which is Davie's final destination.<PARAGRAPH>As Davie travels to Appin , he sees a troop of red-coated soldiers, which makes him worry about Alan.<PARAGRAPH>The fisherman drops Davie off at Lettermore, a forest in Appin.<PARAGRAPH>Davie settles down to eat a bit of bread. He wonders what to do next: should he join an outlaw like Alan, or should he walk south back to his home?<PARAGRAPH>As he's sitting down in this fine birch forest, he sees a group of four travelers coming down the road.<PARAGRAPH>The first is a big red-headed man; the second is a lawyer in black clothes and a white wig; the third is a servant dressed in the plaid of the Campbell family ; and the fourth is a sheriff's officer.<PARAGRAPH>Though he can't explain why, seeing these travelers suddenly makes Davie determined to go on with his plan to join Alan.<PARAGRAPH>He stands up and asks the four for directions to Aucharn.<PARAGRAPH>The big red-headed man turns to the lawyer and says that this seems like a bad omen: he's on his way to Duror \"on the job\"  and here is a boy who's appeared out of the blue to ask directions to Aucharn.<PARAGRAPH>The lawyer, Mungo, says that \"Glenure\"  shouldn't joke about such things.<PARAGRAPH>Red Fox asks Davie what he's looking for in Aucharn.<PARAGRAPH>Davie answers that he's seeking a man who lives there.<PARAGRAPH>Red Fox says, \"James of the Glens\" . He then turns to Mungo the lawyer and suggests that James Stewart might be rallying his troops.<PARAGRAPH>The lawyer answers that it would be better for Red Fox and his group to sit and wait for the English soldiers to come to them.<PARAGRAPH>Davie chips in that he's no servant of either Red Fox or James Stewart, but is loyal to King George.<PARAGRAPH>Red Fox approves of Davie's loyalty to the king, but, as the King's \"Factor\" , he has to wonder why Davie is so far from home, and why he's visiting Ardshiel's brother just now.<PARAGRAPH>Just then, a shot rings out, and Red Fox collapses on the road.<PARAGRAPH>Red Fox cries out, \"O, I am dead!\"  several times over as the lawyer holds him in his arms.<PARAGRAPH>Red Fox fumbles with his jacket looking for his wound. Before he can find it, he dies.<PARAGRAPH>The lawyer goes pale, the servant starts to cry, Davie stands staring, and the sheriff's officer turns back up the road to bring the soldiers faster.<PARAGRAPH>Davie immediately begins running up the side of the hill to track the gunman.<PARAGRAPH>He gets to the top of the hill and sees a big man in a black coat carrying a long flintlock hunting rifle. Davie shouts, \"Here! I see him!\"  and the murderer begins to run away.<PARAGRAPH>Davie loses track of the murderer and doubles back to the scene of the crime. The sheriff's officer and the lawyer gesture for Davie to come back.<PARAGRAPH>The lawyer calls to the soldiers to catch Davie, assuming that he stopped Red Fox intentionally to give the gunman a chance to fire. Davie overhears this call and is absolutely terrified.<PARAGRAPH>It hasn't occurred to Davie that he might be considered a suspect, so he just stands there, with the soldiers are coming towards him.<PARAGRAPH>A voice tells him to \"jouk\"  into the trees, which Davie does. The soldiers start firing after him.<PARAGRAPH>Who could the voice belong to but Alan Breck?<PARAGRAPH>The two run like crazy. Alan occasionally stands up tall to give the soldiers pursuing them a chance to see him.<PARAGRAPH>Then, once the two have reached the top of a nearby mountain, they creep back down to Lettermore to throw the soldiers off the track.<PARAGRAPH>There they collapse on the turf, exhausted.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210422032710/http://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/kidnapped/summary/chapter-17"}
