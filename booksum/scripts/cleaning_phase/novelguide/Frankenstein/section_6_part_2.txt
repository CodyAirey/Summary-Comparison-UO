{"name": "volume 2, Chapter 10", "summary": "Chapter 10: This chapter continues Frankenstein's account of his trip into the mountains. To him, the Alps are a place of self-reflection and spiritual awakening. Here, Victor again alludes to the limits of human awareness-the idea that man works too hard to discover secrets he wasn't meant to find. He asks the \"wandering spirits\" if they will let him have some solace from his problems. Soon this solace becomes impossible, however, when the contemptible \"wretch\" that he has created confronts him. The superhuman monster demands that Victor listen to his story; otherwise, the beast says, \"I will glut the maw of death, until it be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends. Victor is horrified and disgusted by the monster's proposal, but agrees at least to listen to the being's story. The superhuman alludes to his own contempt for mankind, and especially for his creator, describing himself as a fallen angel not allowed even the faintest hint of the happiness he witnesses in humans", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200927043357/https://www.novelguide.com/frankenstein/summaries/chap9-10"}
