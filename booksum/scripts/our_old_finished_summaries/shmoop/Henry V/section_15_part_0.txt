Bourbon goes on and on about the magnificence of his horse and Orleans points out that Bourbon talks about it like it's his girlfriend or something. Bourbon confesses that he once wrote a sonnet to his beloved steed. After some discussion among the men about the similarities between riding one's horse and \"riding\" a woman, Bourbon declares, \"I had rather have my horse to my mistress.\" When Bourbon runs off to get ready for battle , the Constable and Orleans take the opportunity to talk trash about him. A messenger arrives with news that the English are only 1500 paces from the French encampment. Orleans and the Constable talk about what an idiot King Henry has turned out to be. The English army has no idea they're about to get pummeled by the French soldiers.", "analysis": ""}
