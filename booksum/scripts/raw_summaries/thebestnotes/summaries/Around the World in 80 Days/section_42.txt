{"name": "character analysis", "summary": "Phileas Fogg  -  This precise and \nintelligent man is one to the most memorable characters of Verne. When we are \nintroduced to him, he is an English man who lives a very regularized life. He \nis impeccable in his manners and is very punctual as well as particular about \nwhat he wants. If it weren\u2019t for the title we would never have guessed that he \nmakes a plan to go around the world. What is most distinct about his character \nis his eccentricity and even his trip around the world results out of a stubborn \nquirk and not out of a greed for the wager money.<PARAGRAPH>While Fogg does travel \naround the world he does not really bother to find out more about the possible \nsources of tourist interest that he passes through. Surprisingly if anyone had \na conversation with Fogg regarding the very same places, he would know a lot about \nthem. It is the volatility and fire beneath the calm exterior that makes Fogg \nso very attractive.<PARAGRAPH>Another outstanding trait of Fogg is his large heartedness. \nHe decides to help the sacrificial victim, Aouda and risks his own life in the \nbargain. The same attribute in Fogg enables him to pardon Passepartout despite \nthe latter\u2019s many blunders. Towards the end of the novel, Fogg even forgives the \ndetective who had put so many hurdles in Fogg\u2019s path. Fogg goes to the extent \nof giving Fix some money, while anyone else in Fogg\u2019s place would have been livid \nwith anger.<PARAGRAPH>As the protagonist of the story, Fogg demands a great deal \nof attention. It is he who sets most of the action rolling and it is he who initiates \nthe entire adventure. He never gives up despite all odds and hires boats, captures \nships, rides on a snow mobile and even hires a train in order to attain his goal.<PARAGRAPH>Verne adds an unexpected twist in the story when the precise Fogg slips \nup and mistakes the time. He thinks he has reached London late, when in fact, \nhe reaches it a full day earlier. The entire England and the readers too cheer, \nwhen Fogg wins the wager and manages to go around the world in the stipulated \nperiod.<PARAGRAPH>Verne shows growth in Fogg\u2019s character. While Verne celebrates \nFogg\u2019s rationality and his detachment at the end Verne maintains that Fogg attains \nnothing but love through his entire endeavor. He may have won a wager, which is \ngood for his pride but more than anything else he finds lasting love, which is \nwonderful for his heart. Aouda would have kept Fogg very happy and we are glad \nthat the ex-shipman marries the exotic Indian princess.<PARAGRAPH>Passepartout  - Fogg\u2019s valet, Passepartout is a foil to Fogg\u2019s \ncharacter. This interesting Frenchman is an integral part of the story, from the \nvery first chapter. He is shown as a man, who is on the lookout for some peace \nand quiet after having had a very exciting and adventurous life. It is for this \nreason that he decides to serve the impeccable Fogg, who comes across as a meticulous \nman, who will not undertake travels. Passepartout soon realizes that he is completely \nwrong for Fogg suddenly plans a journey around the world and Passepartout is tugged \nalong. This journey is not undertaken at a leisurely pace but is completed at \na hectic gallop complete with many bumps.<PARAGRAPH>While Passepartout is very loyal, \nit is he who serves to delay his master several times. Passepartout is na\u00efve \nto a certain extent and tends to get carried away at several occasions. While \nFogg, Aouda and Passepartout are at Hong Kong, Passepartout gets opiated in the \ncompany of Fix and is unable to inform his master about the change in the departure \ntime of the Carnatic. Fogg is thus forced to hire a special boat to Shanghai. \nLater in the story while the group is traversing America, Passepartout is taken \ncaptive by the Sioux. Fogg\u2019s journey is delayed yet again, while he decides to \nrescue his menial-Passepartout. But the worst blow comes when Fogg is arrested \nby detective Fix in England. Passepartout can be greatly held blame for this arrest. \nHe should have warned his master about Fix\u2019s suspicions regarding the robbery, \nbut he didn\u2019t. Passepartout does feel guilty that he is a major source of delay \nas well as financial loss to his master. On the other hand, he makes up for his \nerrors by his jovial nature and his unflinching love and loyalty for his master. \nMoreover it is Passepartout who takes the most crucial step in the rescue of Aouda. \nIt is he who manages to lift her from the sacrificial pyre by pretending to be \nthe dead Rajah reawakened. Thus while Aouda\u2019s rescue is Fogg\u2019s idea, it is Passepartout \nwho makes it possible.<PARAGRAPH>At the end of the book Fogg is grateful to Passepartout \nagain. It is Passepartout who goes to the Reverend Samuel Wilson, of the Parish \nof Marylebone, in order to tell him about Fogg and Aouda\u2019s planned wedding. When \nhe requests the priest to marry the couple, he realizes that the next day is Sunday, \nnot Monday. He rushes back to his master and drags him to the Reform Club. Fogg \nwins the wager as a result of his menial\u2019s last minute realization of their joint \nmistake.<PARAGRAPH>Both Fogg and Aouda are fond of the funny Passepartout. Fogg \ngives Passepartout a part of the money he wins, while Aouda gives this French \nman her affection and care.<PARAGRAPH>Passepartout serves to add a comic touch to \nthe story with his antics. He is all the more interesting because he has been \nan acrobat before. His little role as a long nosed acrobat in Japanese clothes \nis a very bright cameo. His lightheartedness and his blunders are in complete \ncontrast to Fogg\u2019s seriousness and meticulousness. Together they make an unforgettable \npair. Passepartout enthralls the audience and the readers grow to like this crazy, \neccentric Frenchman.<PARAGRAPH>Detective Fix  - He is the closest \nto being termed the \u2018antagonist\u2019 in this story of a challenge to travel around \nthe world in eighty days. He appears in the fifth chapter and is then a permanent \nfeature in the story till the very end. Mr. Fix is one of the many detectives \nwho are on the trail of the infamous robber of the Bank of England. Somehow he \ngets suspicious of Mr. Fogg and starts to believe passionately that it is none \nother than Fogg who is guilty of the bank robbery. Fix has a drawing of the suspected \nculprit that is given to all detectives. The portrait happens to resemble Fogg\u2019s \npersona and this strengthens Fix\u2019s conviction about Fogg\u2019s guilt. Thus, Fix decides \nto obtain a warrant to arrest Fogg. The catch is that the warrant takes time to \nreach Fix and till then he has to shadow Fogg all over the world. He succeeds \nin placing many obstacles in Fogg\u2019s path without Fogg ever realizing that Fix \nis out to ruin his plans. Fix befriends Passepartout with the sole aim of keeping \na tab on Fogg. Passepartout\u2019s naivete and innocence makes him incapable of smelling \na rat in Fix\u2019s pretended friendly behavior.<PARAGRAPH>Fix is not at all a straightforward \nman. In his desperation to get hold of the reward money that a detective gets \nfor arresting a robber, he even goes to the extent of intoxicating Passepartout \nwith opium. Passepartout is then unable to inform his master about the change \nin the departure time of a ship and Fogg is delayed as a result. Previously it \nwas Fix, who encouraged the Indian priests of a pagoda at Malabar Hill, to pursue \nPassepartout till Calcutta in order to arrest the latter on the change of desecrating \na holy place. Indeed, Fix\u2019s antics make the reader detest him. We are even more \nfrustrated, when Passepartout does not tell his master about Fix after having \nlearnt the latter\u2019s true identity. Thus Fix continues to accompany Fogg and his \ngroup on their travels. He is shameless in that he accepts Fogg\u2019s offer to travel \nwith the group on special ships and trains, without contributing to the finances \nthat make these exclusive conveyances possible.<PARAGRAPH>While viewing Fogg\u2019s gallantry \nin America, Fix does have a twinge of embarrassment at whether his suspicious \nare mistaken but these thoughts remain passing whims only. The only place where \nFix does help Fogg is when he arranges for a unique mode of conveyance from Fort \nKearney to Omaha Station and that is by a sledge. There is of course a very selfish \nreason behind this extended help. Fix too wishes to reach English soil as soon \nas possible, so that he may arrest Fogg. He cannot arrest Fogg in America. Fix \nfinally does arrest Fogg at Liverpool and Fogg is imprisoned. When Fogg is released \nwith due apologies, he hits Fix and this is a blow that Fix very much deserves.<PARAGRAPH>What is most amazing is that despite Fix\u2019s misbehavior, Fogg feels sorely \nsorry for the defeated Fix and gives him some part of the wager money that he \nwins. We can imagine how Fix would have been indebted to Fogg and his generously \nfor the rest of his life.<PARAGRAPH>Aouda  - Aouda, as a beautiful \nand exotic Indian princess is a major source of glamour in the novel. In a story, \nwhich is mainly about men, Aouda is the sole source of femininity. Fogg and his \ngroup come across her while traveling through India. In fact, the story of her \nrescue is one of the most dramatic episodes in the novel. She is a rich princess \nwho is forcibly married to an old rajah after her father\u2019s death. When the rajah \ntoo passes away, she is forced to commit \u2018suttee\u2019- that is sacrifice of the wife\u2019s \nlife on the funeral pyre of the husband\u2019s. Being young and intelligent, she obviously \ndoes not want to sacrifice herself but she is literally intoxicated with opium \nby the fanatic priests and is trapped by them.<PARAGRAPH>Fogg and his companions \nhad hired an elephant to take them to Allahabad. The guide relates Aouda\u2019s story \nto them when they see the procession of priests with Aouda. Fogg in a rare emotional \nmoment insists on trying to rescue Aouda. Finally through the courageous daring \nof Passepartout the princess is saved from the jaws of death. She is then eternally \ngrateful to both Fogg and Passepartout for the rest of her life.<PARAGRAPH>It is \ndecided that she will travel with Fogg till Hong Kong, where she will ask one \nof her rich relatives for aid. But when they reach Hong Kong, they find out that \nthe relative has moved away. Thus Aouda accompanies Fogg in his journey around \nthe world. Despite Fogg\u2019s cold exterior Aouda senses a warm heart beneath and \nfalls in love with him. Passepartout alone can sense that Aouda\u2019s feelings for \nFogg surpass mere gratefulness but Fogg shows no apparent sign of reciprocity. \nBut nevertheless, we learn that Fogg does love Aouda and he confesses his love \ntowards the end of the novel. Aouda and Fogg do marry and Passepartout is especially \nhappy to see two of his favorite people yoked together.<PARAGRAPH>Aouda seems to \nbe the perfect companion for a man such as Fogg. She is shown as beautiful, polished \nin manners and kind at heart. Moreover, she is just as self-respecting as Fogg \nhimself is and is also equally brave. When they are attacked by the Sioux in America, \nshe puts up a courageous fight. She gets hold of arms and defends herself magnificently. \nShe refuses to be left with Passepartout at Kearney station and braves the acute \nsuffering of a journey in the open air in order to accompany Fogg to Omaha station.<PARAGRAPH>Verne uses the character of Aouda to drive home a crucial point. In the \nlast chapter titled-\u2018In which it is shown that Phileas Fogg gained nothing by \ntraveling round the world unless it were happiness, Verne points out that Fogg\u2019s \nultimate victory was not the one of the wager, but one in which he attained Aouda\u2019s \nlove. Verne goes on to write that Aouda was a charming woman, who made Fogg the \nhappiest of men! In Verne\u2019s own words-\u2018And forsooth, who would not go round the \nworld for less?\u2019 the author refers to Aouda as being a more important attainment \nthan the completion of a successful journey round the world. Aouda reiterates \nthe fact that human relationships and love are more important than any number \nof worldly challenges, wagers or money.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141554/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Around_The_World_In_80_Days/Around_The_World_In_Eighty_Days34.html"}
