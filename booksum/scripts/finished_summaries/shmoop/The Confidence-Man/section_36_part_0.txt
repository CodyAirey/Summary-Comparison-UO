The Puritan calls over Egbert, a thirty-something businessman who doesn't seem like the type to be travelling with the Puritan. The Puritan, who we now learn is named Mark Winsome, is heading out, but Egbert is his disciple. Oh, yeah--turns out Winsome has developed a philosophy. He's leaving Egbert behind to tell Frank about it. Frank is surprised, because Winsome seems pie-in-the-sky but is talking like his philosophy has practical applications. Which is it? Winsome: My philosophy is super practical. Egbert will tell you everything.", "analysis": ""}
