{"name": "Part 5, Chapter 3", "summary": "Alexandra is walking with Carl across the fields. After receiving his telegram in Lincoln, she left around midnight, arriving back inHanover in the early morning.<PARAGRAPH>Alexandra has taken off her black travelling suit and is\nwearing a white dress.<PARAGRAPH>Carl looks more or less the same, only a little more tanned.\nStill, he hardly looks like a businessman.<PARAGRAPH>\"There will always be dreamers on the frontier,\"\nthe narrator muses .<PARAGRAPH>It turns out Carl had never received her letter. He heard\nabout Frank's trial when he read about it in a newspaper. Since then, he's been\non his way to Hanover.<PARAGRAPH>Alexandra asks whether Carl could just up and leave his\nbusiness. He reassures her that he trusts his partner to manage everything. He'll\nhave to go back in the spring, and maybe she'll come with him this time. He's\neven started to make some money.<PARAGRAPH>He asks her whether she wants to wait longer, because of the\nrecent events. She says it makes no difference to her; and Carl doesn't need to\nworry about Lou and Oscar, since they're angrier now about Emil, claiming that\nit's Alexandra's fault for sending him to college.<PARAGRAPH>Carl assures her that he's not worried. He knew that she\nneeded him there, so he came for her.<PARAGRAPH>Alexandra tells him how much she needed him when Emil was\nkilled, and then how she thought she should spend the rest of her days alone.\nWhen she got his telegram, everything changed. He's all she has in the world,\nnow.<PARAGRAPH>When Alexandra tells Carl how shocked she is by Marie's betrayal\nof her trust, Carl suggests that it might have been harder for Marie than\nAlexandra thinks. He tells her how he noticed something strange between Marie\nand Emil when he went with Emil to the fair at the French church. He also tells\nher how he saw the two of them at the duck pond, early that one morning.<PARAGRAPH>Some women, he tells her, spread ruin just by being \"too\nbeautiful, too full of life and love\" . She shouldn't be so hard\non Marie.<PARAGRAPH>Alexandra says she tries, but she still doesn't understand\nwhy it had to be Emil, and not one of the other boys.<PARAGRAPH>Because he was the best, and she was the best, he tells her.\nMaybe they were too good for the world.<PARAGRAPH>They continue walking. Alexandra tells Carl that she wants\nto come with him to Alaska in the spring. But she's not sure she wants to leave\nfor good.<PARAGRAPH>When she left the prison, she tells him, she felt like she'd\nnever be free again. But she does feel free, there on the Divide.<PARAGRAPH>Carl tells her that she belongs to the land, just as she\nalways has.<PARAGRAPH>Alexandra agrees. She asks Carl if he remembers something he\nsaid when they visited the graveyard, about the same human stories, repeating\nover and over. Well, Alexandra says, they are the ones who write the stories.<PARAGRAPH>Lou and Oscar don't understand, she continues. They're not the\nones who own the land. They belong to the land. The ones who love and understand the land are the ones who get to\nown it for a while.<PARAGRAPH>Carl asks her why she's thinking about all this. She tells\nhim that she had a dream before she went to visit Frank in Lincoln. She says\nshe'll tell him all about it when they're married.<PARAGRAPH>She realizes now that the dream will never come true, at\nleast not in the way she thought it could.<PARAGRAPH>Carl kisses her. She leans on his shoulder, telling him how tired\nand lonely she's been all this time.<PARAGRAPH>They go inside, leaving the Divide behind them.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219131311/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/o-pioneers/summary/part-5-chapter-3"}
