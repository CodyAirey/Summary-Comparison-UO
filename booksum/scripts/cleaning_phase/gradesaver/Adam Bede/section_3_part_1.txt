{"name": "book 3, Chapter 22", "summary": "Chapter Twenty-Two<PARAGRAPH>The Captain's birthday is at the end of July. Hetty prepares herself in her room, looking at a lovely pair of garnet and pearl earrings that the Captain has given her, which she knows she cannot wear yet. She wears a locket with locks of hair in it hidden in her bosom. Everyone walks towards the Chase, where the great party is to be held. The oldest people all come in a wagon together. The great house was from the time of Queen Anne, but it was attached to the remnant of an old Abbey at one end. Hetty is sad that she has not seen Arthur  yet. PARAGRAPH>The Captain, preparing for dinner, thanks the vicar for his advice: only giving his tenants dinner and doing it earlier in the day, so that his house will not become a riot scene. He says that since Adam is handing out the alcohol, the party will not get out of hand. The Captain confides in the vicar that his grandfather has come around to having Adam manage the estate, although the Captain says that he still does not get along with his grandfather. Adam will dine with the large tenants, and the Captain will announce his new position at dinner", "analysis": "In Chapter Twenty-Two, the Captain's behavior towards his tenants is interestingly old-fashioned.  He seems to take an almost feudal responsibility for them, a fact enhanced by the setting of the tenants' dinner in a room in the old Abbey.  The Captain in no way questions the established social order of his society, but he wants to be--and to appear--as benevolent a master as possible.  He is constantly concerned about his image in the eyes of his tenants, and he uses a possible dip in their feelings toward him as a reason that he should not continue to see Hetty .<PARAGRAPH>The new position for Adam shakes up the established order of the book in the same way that his father's death did. It makes him somewhat more able to marry Hetty.  This new development not only frees him economically, but also it increases his social status, bringing him level with large tenants like the Poysers.<PARAGRAPH>Chapter Twenty-Three shows the differences in character between Hetty and Adam once again, suggesting that they might not make a very good couple.  Adam's humility is highlighted at the beginning of the chapter, showing that he does not want to be elevated above his family.  One moral center in this novel concerns family values, and the fact that Adam does not want to move upward socially without bringing the rest of his family with him is an extremely positive quality in the context of the novel.  Eliot has already remarked, however, that if Hetty were invited to make a great social leap, she would do so without a backward glance.<PARAGRAPH>Two of Hetty's most negative characteristics are highlighted at the end of this chapter.  Her vanity, the most obvious of her sins, is irritated when Totty innocently does something that might spoil Hetty's careful toilette.  Her groundless flirtation is also emphasized here; she smiles winningly at Adam not because she loves him, but because she knows that a competitor is watching.  She wants to retain her hold over Adam even if she does not want him for herself.<PARAGRAPH>In Chapter Twenty-Four, all of the people in the village put on a good, happy, and unanimous face, while they are divided by social barriers and generally feel conflicted about their own troubles.  The Captain is worried that if others learn about his relationship with Hetty, they will think less of him.  Hetty is worried that he does not love her anymore.  Adam is worried that he is letting down his family by moving into a new social sphere.  There are several other worries here.  What Eliot is trying to demonstrate is that, unlike natural events, social events can lend themselves to theatricality, leading people to  play their expected roles instead of interacting and responding as they might do in a more natural way.  The speeches of the men are weighed and judged, and despite the fact that all of the villagers know that Adam means well, some still judge his speech negatively.<PARAGRAPH>Chapter Twenty-Five steps back from the story of the love problems among the Bedes and Poyser nieces to view the community as a whole.  Rather than use the narrator to comment, Eliot brings in Mrs. Irwine as an outsider who rather impartially surveys the community.  The result of this outsider perspective is a more even distribution of praise where praise is deserved. For example, she notices Seth Bede's particularity, though he is usually overshadowed by his more charismatic older brother.<PARAGRAPH>The short episode of Chad's Bess's disappointment is almost more like a fable than a novel.  Chad's Bess is persuaded to do something that she knows she should not be doing--heating herself up too much by racing--in pursuit of some sort of finery as a prize.  She is quite disappointed when she ends up with a prize that is not to her taste.  This fable might do well to instruct Hetty, who is carrying on a relationship that she knows she should not in pursuit of luxury and finery herself.  Chad's Bess's disappointment may foreshadow her own.<PARAGRAPH>Formal dancing is used in Chapter Twenty-Six in a similar way compared with dancing in Victorian fiction. That is, it is a proxy for, or a prelude to, sexual relations.  Certain rules regulate the way that balls, even those as informal as the country dance, are held.  Men must ask women to dance, and people may survey their possible prizes with all of the leisure of someone shopping for vegetables in a market.  Men must not dance too often with the same partner, or else it will be expected that he has serious designs on her and may even be ready to marry her.  For this reason, neither Adam nor the Captain dances with Hetty more than once.<PARAGRAPH>The fact that Adam sees the locket, which is obviously so fine as to be a gift from the Captain, suggests that Hetty's secret cannot remain a secret for very much longer.  Even though she tries to hide the signs of her love, and though she is fairly successful at making others believe that her emotions are linked to men other than the Captain, she ultimately will be unsuccessful at hiding such a big secret.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210804032318/https://www.gradesaver.com/adam-bede/study-guide/summary-book-third"}
