{"name": "Book 6, Chapter 2", "summary": "Lucy and Maggie are hanging out and chatting.<PARAGRAPH>Maggie is in a good mood and is displaying her very sarcastic sense of humor.<PARAGRAPH>The two are discussing Stephen Guest.

Maggie confesses she is often jealous of happy people.<PARAGRAPH>Lucy reassures Maggie and tells her to cheer up and stop being a Debbie Downer.<PARAGRAPH>Lucy goes to put on some jewelry since Stephen is coming over, and Maggie starts to cry a little once she\u2019s alone. Maggie is finding it hard to be home again in St. Ogg\u2019s since she has lots of bad memories, and good ones too, in the place.<PARAGRAPH>Lucy comes back and tells Maggie that they\u2019re going to listen to tons of music, which is sure to cheer Maggie up.<PARAGRAPH>Then Lucy mentions Philip Wakem and watches Maggie\u2019s reaction. Maggie explains that she likes Philip and tries to tell Lucy about Tom forbidding her to see Philip \u2013 apparently there wasn\u2019t an expiration date on Maggie\u2019s promise to Tom to not see Philip again.<PARAGRAPH>But, before she can get into all that, Stephen shows up.<PARAGRAPH>Stephen is shocked when he meets Maggie, since he was expecting her to be blonde and dim-witted like her mom.<PARAGRAPH>Lucy laughs at Stephen\u2019s surprise and he mock scolds her for tricking him.<PARAGRAPH>Maggie is not amused that Stephen had made negative assumptions about her before even meeting her.<PARAGRAPH>Maggie decides that Stephen is conceited.

A bazaar is a type of marketplace. In this context, it refers to a sort of fundraiser, rummage-sale thing. Lucy and Maggie are sewing things to sell at the bazaar, which will presumably raise money for something like a local church.<PARAGRAPH>Stephen comments on Maggie\u2019s rather plain sewing and Maggie explains to him and Lucy that she learned to make very basic items in order to sell them and make money.<PARAGRAPH>Stephen is impressed by Maggie\u2019s candor about her financial situation and her lack of embarrassment about it.<PARAGRAPH>They then discuss Dr. Kenn, who is the new clergyman in town. Lucy talks about the charity work he does and Maggie finds it really impressive and admirable.<PARAGRAPH>(Historical Context Lesson! Stephen gives us a brief rundown of religious politics in England. Dr. Kenn is an Anglican, which is the official religion of England. The Anglican church is the equivalent of the Episcopalian church in America. The dissenters Stephen mentions are other groups of Protestants, like Methodists, and Catholics. Basically, people can choose not to belong to the Anglican church even though it is technically the official religion.)<PARAGRAPH>Stephen starts showing off how smart he is and tells the girls all about some books he is reading.<PARAGRAPH>Maggie finds this interesting and Stephen is practically hypnotized by Maggie\u2019s gaze.<PARAGRAPH>Lucy doesn\u2019t notice this.<PARAGRAPH>The group then decide to go rowing up the river Floss.<PARAGRAPH>Lucy and Stephen are alone for a minute and discuss having Philip over tomorrow.
