{"name": "Chapter 5", "summary": "The meal is over.<PARAGRAPH>Mattie cleans up and Ethan does the final chores.<PARAGRAPH>The snow is coming down hard.<PARAGRAPH>The scene is just as he imagined it. Mattie by the fire, sewing, and he is now puffing the pipe, stretching the hard-working legs.<PARAGRAPH>Ethan can't see Mattie where she's sitting so he suggests that she sit in Zeena's chair.<PARAGRAPH>Actually Mattie gets up and sits in the chair.<PARAGRAPH>This turns out to a bad idea. It's almost as if as if Mattie turns into Zeena.<PARAGRAPH>Mattie also seems to feel uncomfortable about this arrangement and goes back to her initial position.<PARAGRAPH>Ethan steals glances at her from his spot.<PARAGRAPH>The cat takes over Zeena's chair.<PARAGRAPH>As the quiet sets in they relax and talk.<PARAGRAPH>Ethan reminds Mattie that they had a coasting date for tonight.<PARAGRAPH>Because there is no moon, they decide to postpone sledding for the following evening. Mattie is blushing furiously.<PARAGRAPH>Ethan asks her if she would be too afraid to sled with him on a moonless night.<PARAGRAPH>She says she's scared of nothing.<PARAGRAPH>He says that he is actually afraid. Sledding on a moonless night is a good way to die.<PARAGRAPH>In the dark there is no way to see the killer elm tree.<PARAGRAPH>Ethan decides to tell Mattie that he saw Ruth being kissed.<PARAGRAPH>All night he'd wanted to tell her, but regret was instant. It sounded rough and rude, and triggered more intense blushing from Mattie.<PARAGRAPH>She guesses quietly that he'd seen Ruth and Ned.<PARAGRAPH>Ethan had hoped he might get a kiss of his own that way, though he would have settled for the touch of her hand.<PARAGRAPH>His comments seem to have had the opposite effect.<PARAGRAPH>Ethan thinks he's unusually shy about these kinds of things.<PARAGRAPH>When they were in the open air together they were more free than now that they're indoors.<PARAGRAPH>Mattie and Ethan talk about Ned and Ruth, and how they are planning a summer wedding.<PARAGRAPH>Ethan then suggests that Mattie will be the next to wed.<PARAGRAPH>She wants to know why he keeps bringing that up.<PARAGRAPH>He says it's to help the reality of it sink in for him.<PARAGRAPH>Could it also be because Zeena has a problem with me? Mattie wants to know.<PARAGRAPH>Ethan seems irritated by her question and asks what she's talking about.<PARAGRAPH>She brings up Zeena's behavior the night before.<PARAGRAPH>Well, Ethan says he can't imagine why Zeena might have a problem with Mattie.<PARAGRAPH>This isn't reassuring to Mattie, and wants to know if Zeena said anything to Ethan about her.<PARAGRAPH>Ethan tries to reassure Mattie that Zeena has not said anything. He then begs her, tenderly, to change the topic.<PARAGRAPH>More blushing.<PARAGRAPH>The cat jumps out of Zeena's chair in pursuit of a mouse.<PARAGRAPH>On the coffee table rests the end of the piece of cloth Mattie is sewing.<PARAGRAPH>Ethan touches it and they seem to have some kind of psychic communication through the cloth.<PARAGRAPH>An image of Zeena back in her chair the next day captures Ethan.<PARAGRAPH>Mattie seems to pick up his anxiety over this.<PARAGRAPH>So Ethan, in a daze, kisses the end of the piece of cloth, with his eyes closed.<PARAGRAPH>When he opens his eyes Mattie is rolling up the piece of cloth and preparing to leave the room.<PARAGRAPH>Together they bring the geranium flowers away from the windows so they don't get frozen in the night.<PARAGRAPH>Ethan's candle in her hand, Mattie goes up stairs, telling him good night.<PARAGRAPH>The sound of Mattie's door closing reminds Ethan that \"he had not even touched her hand\" (5.41).", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210420064521/http://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/ethan-frome/summary/chapter-5"}
