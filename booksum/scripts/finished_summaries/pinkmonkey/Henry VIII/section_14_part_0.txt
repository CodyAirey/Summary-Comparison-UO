The council is united against Cranmer. They use their power to keep him waiting outside. This is a direct insult to Cranmer, who being part of the council has the right to go in. His rise to power has rankled many men and they do this to shame Cranmer, who must now face the full force of their planned action against him. The action gathers more momentum when the King is made aware of the whole situation. Enraged by the shabby treatment of Cranmer, who is a personal friend of his, the Kings displeasure mounts, and he leaves for the council chamber. With the Kings angry departure the tension in the scene is further heightened and the resolution of the matter is imminent."}
