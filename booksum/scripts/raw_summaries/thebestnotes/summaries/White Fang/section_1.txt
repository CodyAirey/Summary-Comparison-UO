{"name": "chapter 2", "summary": "After the men finish their breakfast \nand load their gear onto the sled, they set out in the darkness, as the wolves \ncontinue to howl. Daybreak comes at nine in the morning, and the sky warms to \na rose color at mid day. The light, however, quickly fades in the afternoon, and \nit grows dark again, forcing the men to stop. As the wolves\u0092 cries get closer \nand closer to their camp, the dogs are thrown into a panic. Henry is preparing \nfood when he hears a different cry coming from the dogs. He then notices a strange \ndog among his own and thinks that perhaps it is a tame wolf. The next morning, \nHenry wakes up to Bill\u0092s curses. Another dog, Frog, has disappeared. The men eat \ntheir breakfast, harness the four dogs to the sled, and leave, pursued by the \nwolves.<PARAGRAPH>When they stop for the night, Bill ties the dogs in such a manner \nthat they cannot tangle their traces anymore, and he is confident that none of \nthe dogs can get away. Just then, One Ear begins to whine. The men see the \u0093dog-like \nanimal,\u0094 the she-wolf, who has been luring the dogs away so that her pack can \nfeed on them. They realize that she is quite tame and must have had some experience \nwith humans. The next morning Spanker is gone. The men later find the stick to \nwhich Spanker was tied and conclude that the wolves have killed him.<PARAGRAPH>Bill \ngoes to take a look at the wolves and comes back with the news that they are very \nthin and desperately hungry. They see the she-wolf approaching them again. She \nis over two feet tall at the shoulder and five feet long, with a gray wolf coat \nthat has an unusual reddish hue. She is not a bit scared of the men and eyes them \nhungrily. Bill is tempted to use his gun, but Henry advises him against it, reminding \nhim they have only three cartridges left. Besides, the she-wolf has already disappeared \ninto the woods. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Your browser does not support the IFRAME tag.<PARAGRAPH>The other wolves are getting bolder as they approach the men, \nbut the remaining dogs manage to hold them off. Bill has lost hope by now and \nis sure that the wolves will eventually overpower them. When Henry snaps at him, \nhe does not even get a response from Bill. Henry resolves to try to lift his companion\u0092s \nspirits the next day.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025238/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/White_Fang/White_Fang08.html"}
