A letter soon arrives from Mr. Collins saying that he has heard of their misfortune, and writing Mr. Bennet that it would be best for him to \"throw off your unworthy child from your affections for ever. Mr. Gardiner writes again saying he has no news yet other than that Wickham does not seem to have any family or friends that they could be staying with, and that he left a number of gambling debts in Brighton. Mr. Bennet returns home, and Mrs. Gardiner and her children leave.
