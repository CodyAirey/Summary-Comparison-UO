{"name": "book 8, Chapter 79", "summary": "PARAGRAPH>Chapter 79:<PARAGRAPH>Summary:<PARAGRAPH>Lydgate puts Rosamond to bed, still not totally aware of what has caused her distress. Will comes over, but Rosamond has not mentioned Will's visit earlier in the day; Will makes no mention of it to Lydgate either. Lydgate tells Will a bit of what has been going on, and that his name has also been mixed up in the proceedings. Will is not surprised, and almost does not care, because he thinks that Dorothea has already given up on him. When Lydgate mentions Dorothea's name, he notices that Will has a very peculiar reaction; he suspects that there is something between the two, and in this, he is correct. PARAGRAPH>Analysis:<PARAGRAPH>Even more interesting than what is said in this chapter, is what is left unsaid by the characters. Will leaves out his crucial information regarding Rosamond's \"illness,\" and the major part he played in that; Rosamond does not tell her husband that Dorothea has been there, when this is information of the utmost importance. Will does not tell Lydgate that he too was offered money by Bulstrode, but was lucky enough to refuse it. Perhaps all these facts will come out, but perhaps not; if they do come out, they might do some minor damage or nothing at all, depending upon context and situation. Secrets have a peculiar way of acting, once they are out; it can never be predicted, especially in Middlemarch, what will come out, and what harm, if any, it will cause", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210125120143/https://www.gradesaver.com/middlemarch/study-guide/summary-chapters-78-finale"}
