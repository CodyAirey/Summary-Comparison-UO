{"name": "Part 4, Chapter 2", "summary": "Gulliver and the gray horse go about three miles, to a long, low building.<PARAGRAPH>Gulliver sees several horses doing housework and thinks that the people who tamed these animals to such a degree must be the smartest people who ever were.<PARAGRAPH>Gulliver starts to think he's hallucinating, because he can't figure out (a) where the people are, and (b) what kind of man needs to be served by horses.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, Gulliver arrives at a building far from the main house, which has three of those gross, hairy animals from the previous chapter chained to the wall.<PARAGRAPH>They are eating roots and meat from animals that have died by accident \u2013 donkeys, dogs, and cows.<PARAGRAPH>The horse leader orders \"the sorrel nag\" (\"sorrel\" meaning a kind of chestnut or reddish color, \"nag\" meaning horse) to unchain one of the beasts and bring him to Gulliver.<PARAGRAPH>When Gulliver sees this beast close up, he realizes that what the horses have been calling Yahoos are actually men: their hands have uncut nails, and they are a bit hairier and more calloused than Gulliver, but still, they are unmistakably human beings.<PARAGRAPH>What is clearly confusing the horses is that Gulliver has the head of a Yahoo, but his body is pretty different: they don't understand that his clothes are not part of his skin.<PARAGRAPH>The horses see that Gulliver truly loathes the Yahoos, and that he also can't eat the raw meat they eat.<PARAGRAPH>Gulliver sees a cow passing and indicates that he will milk her, which is how he finally feeds himself.<PARAGRAPH>Around noon, an elderly horse appears in a carriage drawn by 4 Yahoos.<PARAGRAPH>He settles down with the gray horse to a lunch of hay, mashed oats, and milk.<PARAGRAPH>They all appear extremely well-mannered, modest, and decent.<PARAGRAPH>After lunch, the gray horse (whom Gulliver has started calling the Master Horse) indicates that he's worried that Gulliver has eaten so little.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, Gulliver figures out a way to make a kind of bread out of oats, which he eats with milk. And even though it's not the most delicious food in the world, a steady diet of this stuff makes him really healthy.<PARAGRAPH>Gulliver spends his first night lying in straw between the house and the Yahoo stable.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210619223131/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/gullivers-travels/summary/part-4-chapter-2"}
