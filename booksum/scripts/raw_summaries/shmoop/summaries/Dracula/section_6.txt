{"name": "Chapter 7", "summary": "The chapter opens with a newspaper article that Mina has pasted in her journal about the great storm of August 8.<PARAGRAPH>The newspaper describes the storm very vividly\u2014the tone doesn't sound much like a modern newspaper.<PARAGRAPH>As the storm was getting really rough, lots of townspeople gathered on the hill above town to watch the strange ship that was coming into town.<PARAGRAPH>Everyone commented on how strangely it was being steered.<PARAGRAPH>The storm was getting pretty ridiculous.<PARAGRAPH>Everyone was afraid the ship would be sunk on rocks or would crash into the pier as it came into the harbor.<PARAGRAPH>When it got close, the people watching realized why it was being steered so haphazardly: The pilot was dead. He was just tied to the helm and kind of flopped back and forth with every wave.<PARAGRAPH>Miraculously, though, the ship made it safely to the beach.<PARAGRAPH>As it hit the shore, a big dog leaped out and disappeared.<PARAGRAPH>Mina learns that the strange ship is from Varna (a town on the Black Sea) and that its cargo was just a bunch of wooden boxes filled with dirt.<PARAGRAPH>No one ever found the strange dog that jumped out of the ship, although a lot of people looked for it.<PARAGRAPH>Mina gets permission from the Board of Trade inspector to copy down the log of the captain of the ship (translated from the Russian by a local clerk).<PARAGRAPH>The chapter continues with Mina's copy of the captain's log.<PARAGRAPH>The voyage starts out fine\u2014they take on their cargo and leave as usual. The crew seems nervous about something, though.<PARAGRAPH>On July 16, one of the crew goes missing.<PARAGRAPH>On July 17, another member of the crew tells the captain that he saw a strange man on the ship.<PARAGRAPH>The captain thinks it is just superstition, but he has the ship searched anyway.<PARAGRAPH>On July 24, another man disappears.<PARAGRAPH>There is a big storm, and then another man disappears.<PARAGRAPH>At least they're getting close to England.<PARAGRAPH>On August 3, even the first mate starts acting weird\u2014he claims to have seen something that he just calls \"It\" and swears he'll find it and kill it.<PARAGRAPH>The captain assumes the first mate has gone crazy.<PARAGRAPH>The first mate comes back out on deck and throws himself overboard.<PARAGRAPH>The captain finally believes that something is wrong... and he figures out what it is.<PARAGRAPH>He doesn't want to throw himself overboard, since he's the captain. So he ties himself to the helm with a rosary between his hands to keep \"It\" away.<PARAGRAPH>And so his log entries ended.<PARAGRAPH>Mina says that the captain was going to be given a hero's burial in Whitby because he stayed at his post until death.<PARAGRAPH>Mina plans on watching the funeral procession.<PARAGRAPH>Lucy is sleepwalking again\u2014she got up twice during the night to get dressed, and so Mina kept having to get up and put Lucy back to bed again.<PARAGRAPH>The old man who had befriended Mina and Lucy is found dead at their favorite seat up on the hill above the town: His neck was broken.<PARAGRAPH>That was the day of the funeral procession for the ship's captain, which Lucy and Mina went to watch.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219141110/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/dracula/summary/chapter-7"}
