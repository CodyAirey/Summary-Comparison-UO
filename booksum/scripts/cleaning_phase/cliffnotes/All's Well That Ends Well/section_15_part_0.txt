Helena asks him to speed ahead with a message for the king.\nIn Rousillon, Parolles is begging the clown to deliver a letter of his own to Lafeu, when that gentleman appears. After teasing Parolles about his fallen status, Lafeu shows pity and bids Parolles to follow him to the count's palace , saying, \"Though you are a fool and a knave, you shall eat.\"", "analysis": "Noteworthy here is the clown's relish in teasing Parolles with numerous scatological references to the \"stench\" he finds himself in with Fortune and society -- \"Fortune's close-stool\"  and \"a purn  of Fortune\" -- and Lafeu's contrasting good-humored forgiveness of the knavish fellow.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201101100305/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/a/alls-well-that-ends-well/summary-and-analysis/act-v-scenes-12"}
