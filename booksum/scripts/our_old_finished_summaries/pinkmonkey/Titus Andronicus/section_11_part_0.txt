{"name": "Scene 1", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820050202/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmTitus23.asp", "summary": "Lucius is gathered near Rome with the Goths and he urges them to avenge their defeat. At this moment Aaron and his child are brought to him as prisoners. Lucius is able to guess that Tamora is the mother of Aarons child and decides to kill the baby. In exchange for his childs life Aaron promises to give Lucius important information. He reveals to Lucius the identity of Lavinias mutilators, the plot that convicted Quintus and Martius, and the trick that make Titus lose his hand. He also admits that he was behind all the plots against Titus family. When asked, he says that he is not sorry for anything that he has done. Lucius believes that hanging is going to be a very easy and simple death for Aaron. At this moment Aemilius comes with Saturninus invitation for a parley with Lucius at Titus house, which Lucius accepts.", "analysis": "Notes Act V opens with Lucius and the rapid development of the revenge action. In Act V orthodox order has to be restored. This is represented by Lucius who represents stability. He stands above both Titus and Aaron who represent chaos. Aaron dominates the scene, and admits to being a wicked man. But his wickedness is without any hypocrisy mixed in it. He is aware of what he is and, what is more, he is proud it. He looks at death in torment with equanimity that wins the readers respect for him. Although he is himself devoid of a \"conscience\" he doesnt hesitate to appeal to Lucius good nature to come upon an agreement that will save his sons life."}
