{"name": "Volume II, Chapters I-IV", "summary": "Summary of Vol. II, Chapter I<PARAGRAPH>Catherine calls on the Tilneys at home, but her \u201cexpectations of pleasure\u201d are not met by the rather disappointing visit. Henry and Miss Tilney are not in good spirits, though they are unfailingly polite. Catherine does not attribute this to General Tilney\u2019s presence since he is so warm and welcoming to her, but Austen leads us to believe that his children feel suffocated in his company.<PARAGRAPH>Upon hearing about the visit, Isabella speculates that Henry \u201cnever thinks\u201d of Catherine and says that he is very fickle, but Catherine is not in agreement. That evening, Henry asks Catherine to dance at yet another ball. His older brother, Captain Tilney, arrives at the ball and steps away with Henry at the end of the first dance. Catherine is full of suspense until they return and ask Catherine whether Isabella will consent to dance with Captain Tilney. Catherine says that her friend is not dancing that night, and Captain Tilney walks away. Soon, however, Catherine sees Isabella dancing with Captain Tilney. After the dancing is over, Catherine asks Isabella why she changed her mind. Always quick to defend herself, Isabella replies that Captain Tilney would not leave her alone until she agreed to dance with him, yet she also inadvertently reveals that she took pleasure in being his partner. Captain Tilney is such a \u201csmart young fellow,\u201d Isabella says, that \u201cevery eye was upon us.\u201d<PARAGRAPH>The two girls are distracted when Isabella receives a letter from James stating that his father has settled on giving the couple a yearly income of 400 pounds. However, they must wait two to three years to get married. Isabella has a \u201cgrave face\u201d as soon as she reads this news. She thinks that the income will not be enough to give them the kind of comforts she desires, and her mother attempts to console her. Isabella insinuates that Mr. Moreland is being stingy. Catherine is offended at this thrust against her father. Isabella recovers her wits in time to say that she is only upset at the prospects of the long engagement ahead of them because she is so eager to get married to James. Catherine tries to believe Isabella\u2019s assertion and make amends with her future sister-in-law.<PARAGRAPH>Summary of Vol. II, Chapter II<PARAGRAPH>The Allens decide to extend their visit to Bath by three weeks, and Catherine is delighted because she does not want to part with the Tilneys. When Catherine goes over to the Tilneys\u2019 house to share the happy news, Miss Tilney tells her that her father has decided to move the entire household back home at the end of the week. Catherine is crestfallen until General Tilney invites her to their house in the country, Northanger Abbey. Catherine is ecstatic and accepts the invitation. Both the Allens and her parents approve of the visit. Not only will Catherine be near Henry, she will also be able to explore the ancient house, which was originally an abbey where nuns lived. Catherine looks forward to exploring the historical building and wonders that the Tilneys should take no apparent pride in owning such an estate.<PARAGRAPH>Summary of Vol. II, Chapter III<PARAGRAPH>Catherine and Isabella reunite at the Pump Room one morning. They sit down on a bench near the entrance, in view of everyone who is arriving. Isabella keeps looking at the door, and Catherine thinks that she is looking for James. She assures her that James will be here soon, but Isabella says that she doesn\u2019t always have to be near her fianc\u00e9e\u2019s side. Isabella tells Catherine that John is in love with her and wishes to \u201curge his suit\u201d of marriage. John has told Isabella that Catherine encouraged his attentions before he left Bath. Catherine is shocked. She doesn\u2019t have the slightest affection for John, and she tells Isabella to pass along the message.<PARAGRAPH>Isabella returns the conversation to money matters and continues to fret over the small income James will receive. In the form of seemingly altruistic advice to Catherine, Isabella drops several hints that she regrets accepting James\u2019 proposal. She tells Catherine that \u201cif you are in too great a hurry, you will certainly live to regret it.\u201d Captain Tilney appears and sits down on the bench. Catherine is shocked to hear him flirting with Isabella, and Isabella returning his flirtatious comments. As she listens to their whispered exchange, Catherine feels jealous and betrayed for her brother\u2019s sake, but she wants to believe that Isabella is only \u201cunconsciously\u201d encouraging Captain Tilney\u2019s attentions. As their session in the Pump Room concludes, Catherine dismisses John\u2019s affectionate message, but she cannot forget Isabella\u2019s puzzling behavior.<PARAGRAPH>Summary of Vol. II, Chapter IV<PARAGRAPH>Catherine continues to observe Isabella over the course of the next few days. Isabella appears less warm to James than before, and to make matters worse she continues to flirt with Captain Tilney. Catherine appeals to Henry to convince his brother to leave Bath, but Henry says that persuasion is not in his power. He reasons that James should feel secure enough in Isabella\u2019s affection not to be threatened by the presence of Captain Tilney. Catherine is comforted by Henry\u2019s logic. Furthermore, Isabella behaves well during Catherine\u2019s last night in Bath, and she is cautiously optimistic about her brother\u2019s engagement as she leaves for Northanger Abbey.", "analysis": "Austen highlights Isabella\u2019s questionable loyalty to her fianc\u00e9e in Vol. II, Chapter I. Not only does Isabella agree to dance with Captain Tilney after telling Catherine she won\u2019t dance that night, but her greed is made apparent when she receives the news that she and James will only be provided with a modest income. Ever quick to disguise her disappointment, Isabella resorts to a series of appeals designed to convince everyone else that she is a devoted and self-sacrificing woman. She says that she is only concerned about their small income for her fiancee\u2019s sake and that she never thinks of herself. Austen\u2019s characterization of Isabella is thus marked with dramatic irony: while we know that Isabella thinks only about herself and satisfying her own ambitions to marry well, Catherine does not yet know this (though she is beginning to suspect it).<PARAGRAPH>Vol. II, Chapters I and II are also important because through them we get a fuller portrait of the Tilneys. For the first time, Austen lets us know that the Tilneys are a less-than-ideal family. Like his father General Tilney, Captain Tilney is a proud man who seeks to have his own way in all things.  Catherine notes that his \u201cair is more assuming\u201d than Henry\u2019s. Although Catherine is quick to excuse Captain Tilney\u2019s behavior at the ball due to his family name, we see his presumptuous nature when he refuses to leave without dancing with Isabella. Similarly, General Tilney\u2019s abrupt departure from Bath is emblematic of his impatient nature. Catherine\u2019s invitation to visit the Tilneys at Northanger Abbey assures us that she will get a deeper glimpse into the inner workings of their fraught family life.<PARAGRAPH>The friendship between Isabella and Catherine is compromised by the former\u2019s growing flirtation with Captain Tilney in Vol. II, Chapter III. Austen characterizes Isabella\u2019s insincerity through her revealing turns of phrase. In the Pump Room, Isabella says that she wants to sit on a bench in plain view of the entrance because it is \u201cso out of the way.\u201d In reality, Isabella desires both to see Captain Tilney and to be seen by him, a mission that is fulfilled when he appears and begins lavishing her with compliments. Catherine has much cause for concern: her friend\u2019s behavior alienates her from their close association. Catherine\u2019s opinion of Isabella as a respectable and loyal is already shifting, though she is eager to dismiss her friend\u2019s scandalous whispering as mere \u201cthoughtlessness.\u201d<PARAGRAPH>In contrast, Isabella is not nearly as generous with Catherine. Isabella slyly accuses Catherine of leading John to believe that she harbored feelings for him and subsequently changing her mind: \u201cwhat one means one day, you know, one may not mean the next.\u201d But we already know that Catherine always says what she means, especially to her close friends. Isabella\u2019s charges against Catherine reflect her own state of mind more than they accurately capture Catherine\u2019s behavior with John. It is James, and not John, who stands to be slighted and betrayed by his love interest. Thus, Isabella\u2019s comments serve as an unintentional self-portrait.<PARAGRAPH>Although Catherine dismisses John\u2019s proposal as a ridiculous venture, she remains deeply concerned about her brother\u2019s engagement to Isabella in Chapter IV. When she endeavors to discern Captain Tilney\u2019s feelings from Henry, she is sidetracked by Henry\u2019s assertion that Isabella\u2019s \u201cgood behavior\u201d should not be dependent on his brother\u2019s absence. Henry paints an idealized portrait of Isabella\u2019s engagement to James. He imagines that \u201cno disagreement between them can be of any duration\u201d and that they will soon laugh over Captain Tilney\u2019s \u201cpassion\u201d after they are married. However, Austen lets us know that no such certainty exists: the very foundation of Isabella\u2019s esteem for James was his supposed financial security. Now that it has diminished, her attention is being spent on his rival suitor.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210622234141/https://www.gradesaver.com/northanger-abbey/study-guide/summary-volume-ii-chapters-i-iv"}
