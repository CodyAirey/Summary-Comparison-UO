{"name": "Chapter  17", "summary": "Chapter 17<PARAGRAPH>Summary<PARAGRAPH>The monster perhaps expects Victor to have a solution for both their predicaments, but the monster soon realizes that Victor wishes to be rid of him, and return to a normal way of life.<PARAGRAPH>The monster offers him a way out. The monster: \"I demand a creature of another sex, but as hideous as myself; the gratification is small, but it is all that I can receive, and it shall content me. It is true, we shall be monsters, cut off from the entire world; but on that account we shall be more attached to one another. '''''.. Oh! My creator, make me happy; let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit!\"<PARAGRAPH>Victor relents and agrees to recreate a monster to be a mate for him.<PARAGRAPH>Interpretation<PARAGRAPH>At first Victor sees a way out of his nightmare when he agrees to provide a creature for the monster as a companion. Just as Victor's doting parents provided a mate for him in the form of Elizabeth, so now Victor will provide a mate for the monster.<PARAGRAPH>Shelley makes it clear that the monster's mate is primarily to be for companionship - a platonic relationship - and no mention is made regarding the monster's sexual needs. Shelley clearly puts great store in companionship, for this is mentioned in Walton's letters at the start of the book.<PARAGRAPH>It is also interesting how Shelley develops the relationship between Victor and his creation. It is almost like a father/son connection, and Victor eventually gives in to his \"son's\" pleadings."}
