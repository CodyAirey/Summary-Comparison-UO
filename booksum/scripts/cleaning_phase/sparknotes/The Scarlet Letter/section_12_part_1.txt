{"name": "Chapter 23", "summary": "Chapter 23: The Revelation of the Scarlet Letter Dimmesdale finishes his Election Day sermon, which focuses on the relationship between God and the communities of mankind, \"with a special reference to the New England which they  here planting in the wilderness. Dimmesdale has proclaimed that the people of New England will be chosen by God, and the crowd is understandably moved by the sermon. As they file out of the meeting hall, the people murmur to each other that the sermon was the minister's best, most inspired, and most truthful ever. As they move toward the town hall for the evening feast, Dimmesdale sees Hester and hesitates. Turning toward the scaffold, he calls to Hester and Pearl to join him. Deaf to Chillingworth's attempt to stop him, Dimmesdale mounts the scaffold with Hester and Pearl. He declares that God has led him there. The crowd stares. Dimmesdale leans on Hester for support and begins his confession, calling himself \"the one sinner of the world. After he concludes, he stands upright without Hester's help and tells everyone to see that he, like Hester, has a red stigma. Tearing away his ministerial garments from his breast, Dimmesdale reveals what we take to be some sort of mark--the narrator demurs, saying that it would be \"irreverent to describe  revelation\"--and then sinks onto the scaffold. The crowd recoils in shock, and Chillingworth cries out, \"Thou hast escaped me. Pearl finally bestows on Dimmesdale the kiss she has withheld from him. The minister and Hester then exchange words. She asks him whether they will spend their afterlives together, and he responds that God will decide whether they will receive any further punishment for breaking His sacred law. The minister bids her farewell and dies", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210228013713/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/scarlet/section13/"}
