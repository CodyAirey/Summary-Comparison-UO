Falling asleep on textbooks: we can relate.<PARAGRAPH>Her elder brother, Jaspert, wakes her up, and they bicker about the airman middy's test she'll be taking that day.<PARAGRAPH>Deryn tries on the clothes she'll be wearing for the test\u2014and if all goes well, for a long time afterward.<PARAGRAPH>They're boy's clothes because Deryn is planning to pass as Dylan and get into the British Air Service. Hey, a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do.<PARAGRAPH>Deryn and Jaspert take an omnibus drawn by a hippoesque (which we assume means something like a hippo) to the Wormwood Scrubs airship field.<PARAGRAPH>Deryn reflects on how unfair it is that she was born a girl and has to lie to fly, when she's so much better at it than so many boys. Ugh\u2014for real.<PARAGRAPH>The new recruits line up on the ascension field, where officers try to intimidate them. Hey, some things never change, even in alternate universes.<PARAGRAPH>Jaspert gets her past Lieutenant Cook, who tells her to get in another line\u2014he also notes that she's really skinny, but he doesn't seem to suspect anything.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210507031130/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/leviathan/summary/chapter-3"}
