Even though Henry is worried (the French army has encircled his camp), he's put on a brave face to comfort his exhausted men.<PARAGRAPH>The Chorus apologizes (again) for the theater's inability to justly portray the upcoming battle of Agincourt.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210516192621/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/henry-v/summary/act-4-prologue"}
