{"name": "literary/historical information", "summary": "William Butcher, the noted critic has written that Verne has a very \nconsiderable renown with the public but is not always known for his writing. Butcher \nexplains that to an average American, Verne was and is the inventor of science \nfiction and predicted much of the twentieth century, including the explorations \nof the depths of the sea, of the interior of the earth, and of outer space. He \nis also meant to have foreseen the submarine, the airplane, and perhaps the motor \ncar. But, the same average man might not be able to recall the actual books where \nthese predictions were made and would know very little about the writer himself.<PARAGRAPH>Amongst the novels with a more or less scientific theme, three or four \nstand out for their originality and popularity. Twenty Thousand Leagues under \nthe Sea - 1870 recounts a submarine with Captain Nemo as the enigmatic hero. \nDramatic episodes pervade the narrative such as the passage under the Antarctic \nice cap, the planting of a flag on the South Pole and the discovery of the ruins \nof Atlantis. But, the source of much interest is the intense if distant relationship \nbetween Nemo and his guest prisoner, Dr. Aronnax, who is also the first person \nnarrator. In A Journey to the Center of the Earth, 1864, Prof Lidenbrock \nand his nephew Axel descend into an extinct volcano in Iceland. They eventually \ndiscover an underground world containing plants, fish, a marine dinosaur, and \nfinally human beings: a dead white man, a Giant Shepherd herding Giant Mastodons. \nThe final episode, where the heroes ride a volcanic eruption on a wooden raft \nis an unlikely event described in the most plausible way possible. From the \nEarth to the Moon, 1866 is a story about a vessel capable of escaping from \nthe Earth\u2019s gravitation. The novel ends with the launch of the three passengers \ntowards outer space. A sequel to the launching of this vessel is provided in Around \nthe Moon, where relatively accurate solutions are found to the \nproblems of airlessness, weightlessness and the navigation of the projectile. \nThe two space volumes are light hearted in tone due to the presence of the character \nArdan, who has his real life image in a close friend of Verne\u2019s and a famous French \nphotographer.<PARAGRAPH>Apart from the above mentioned very well known science fiction \nbooks, there is a another category of popular books by Jules Verne, which include \nthe following: 1873 - Around the World in Eighty Days, which describes \nthe journey undertaken for a bet by an eccentric Englishman called Phileas Fogg. \nThe mood is humorous and the pace fast moving. But, there are also serious points \nto the work - for Verne, the shrinking of the world is caused notably by the end \nof the age of exploration and the building of the railways. In contrast, the 1863 \n- Five Weeks in a Balloon conducts its heroes across the still unexplored \nareas in Central Asia, while playing games with the dates of real exploration, \nand also with those of its own publication. In Travels & Adventures of \nCaptain Hatteras (1866) takes the obsessed captain of the title ever further \nnorth over the Arctic cap. The story involves murder and cannibalism and even \nthe hero is meant to die at the Pole at the end, but Verne\u2019s publisher doesn\u2019t \nlet Verne kill the Captain and the plot is changed. The Mysterious Island\n(1874) represents the culmination of many long maturing Vernian ideas. It \ndeals extensively with the desert island dream, but is also designed to show up \nthe facile and implausible manipulation of the plot in Defoe\u2019s Robinson Crusoe. \nIt re-employs characters from Captaine Grant as well as 20,000 Leagues \nUnder the Sea. Robur - the Conqueror (1866) centers on the still vigorous \ndebate between the protagonists of the \u2018lighter than air\u2019 balloons and the \u2018heavier \nthan air\u2019 fixed wing aircraft and helicopters. Robur is a rebel, a spiritual descendant \nof Nemo, a man whose brilliant aeronautical ideas are ignored and who resorts \nto violence to prove his point. His aircraft is memorable for its ship like characteristics.<PARAGRAPH>From 1875 - 1905, Jules Verne\u2019s novels undergo a large number of transformations. \nThe subject is not always exploration and scientific innovation as it was before, \nbut is more often tourism; the mood is more pessimistic, ironical, or bitter. \nThe British and the Americans are no longer presented favorably, the novels often \nclose with death or madness and the few machines that are depicted are eventually \ndestroyed in the stories. These novels sold progressively less well. It has been \npointed out though that the irony, skepticism, and self-analysis in these novels \nmake them more \u2018modern\u2019 than in the more straightforward novels. Verne\u2019s novels \nof his final thirty years work less well as adventure stories, but many of them \nmay be considered interesting or important in other ways.<PARAGRAPH>The six or seven \nworks that appeared after Verne\u2019s death were very different again. \" Jonathan\" \ngoes much deeper in its analysis of anarchism, socialism and communism than any \nof the previous works; and seems to conclude that solitude is the only satisfactory \nsocial or political solution. The Eternal Adam is \na masterpiece. It ranges 20,000 years forward and back to the very beginnings \nof human history. The narrative includes the Flood, Atlantis and finally the total \ndestruction of civilization. The book seems to conclude that all man\u2019s \" \nefforts in the infinity of time\" are destined to be fruitless, that we must \nrealize the \" eternal recommencement of all things\". The main message \nof the book is that only by benefiting directly from the experience of elders, \ncan man begin to escape the cycle and hence achieve true wisdom. This wisdom is \nsituated somewhere between a hopeless pessimism and a blind optimism.<PARAGRAPH>For a long time critics debated as to why most of Verne\u2019s posthumous releases \nwere so different from those that were published when he was alive. Only in 1978 \nwas the question settled. Piero Gondolo della Riva discovered that there were \nconsiderable differences between the 1905 typescripts of the posthumous works \nand the published works; these differences could be ascribed to the efforts of \nVerne\u2019s son - Michel. Thus, it was shown that \u2018La Mission Barsac\u2019 was mostly by \nMichel and \u2018 L\u2019Eternel Adam\u2019 was probably entirely by him. It has been necessary \nto accept that Michel is an authentic writer in his own right.<PARAGRAPH>The most \npopular of Jules Verne\u2019s novels till now are the three books: Around the World \nin Eighty Days, 20,000 Leagues under the Sea, and A Journey to the Center \nof the Earth. All three have many things alike. For one, they could all be \nclassified as adventure novels. Another is that they all involve a journey of \nsome sort. In Around the World in Eighty Days people journey around the \nworld. In A Journey to the Center of the Earth people are journeying to \nthe center of the earth. And finally in 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, they \nare journeying under water. The settings of these books are very similar, yet \ndifferent. All of them are very exotic. Lush forests at the center of the earth, \nlost cities under water, etc. Also in all three of these books, Verne focuses \non one or two people or things about them, and really emphasizes it. In Around \nthe World in Eighty Days it was how precise Mr. Fogg was about his daily routine. \nIn A Journey to the Center of the Earth it would probably be Professor \nHardwigg\u2019s stubbornness. And in 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Captain Nemo\u2019s \nstrange independence and war against civilization is emphatically emphasized.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141554/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Around_The_World_In_80_Days/Around_The_World_In_Eighty_Days05.html"}
