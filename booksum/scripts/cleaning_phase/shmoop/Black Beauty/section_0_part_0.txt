{"name": "Part 1, Chapter 1", "summary": "Right from the start, this book makes it clear that a human isn't telling this story. Some people might remember their childhood bedroom, or maybe a favorite toy, but our narrator remembers \"a large pleasant meadow with a pond of clean water in it\" .<PARAGRAPH>Next clue about our narrator? His choice of food: \"When I was young, I lived upon my mother's milk, as I could not eat grass\" . Are you thinking this guy's a horse? If you are, grab a gold star because you are super on-point. Meet Black Beauty, the hero and narrator of our story. Of course he's a baby at this point and doesn't even have a name yet, but for our purposes, we'll call him Beauty.<PARAGRAPH>Six other colts live in the meadow with Beauty and his mother. They play together like neighborhood kids on the same block: \" we used to gallop all together round and round the field, as hard as we could go\" .<PARAGRAPH>Because boys will be boys, sometimes Beauty and the colts play a little rough. Beauty's mom, Duchess , calls him over one day and gives him a little lecture. She says the colts are good colts, but don't have great manners, and they're only \"cart-horse colts\" . Beauty, on the other hand, is \"well-bred and well-born\" --his grandfather was a famous racehorse, and his grandmother had the \"sweetest temper\" of any horse ever. So Beauty's mom gives him a major life lesson, which he never forgets: \"I hope you will grow up to be gentle and good, and never learn bad ways; do your work with a good will, lift your feet up well when you trot, and never bite or kick even in play\" .<PARAGRAPH>Beauty calls their owner, Farmer Grey, his \"master\" and says he is a \"good, kind man\" who \"spoke as kindly to us as he did to his little children\" . His nickname for Beauty is \"Darkie,\" and Beauty thinks he and his mom might be their master's favorites.<PARAGRAPH>A ploughboy named Dick who visits their field sometimes throws stones and sticks at the colts. One day, Beauty's master catches him in the act and punishes him for it with a \"box on the ear\" , which means he really smacks him. Beauty's master reads him the riot act, too: \"Bad boy to chase the colts!  I shall not want you on my farm again\" . Beauty says that was the last they saw of Dick, and that Old Daniel, the man who took care of the horses, was \"just as gentle\"  as their master.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201205154804/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/black-beauty/summary/part-1-chapter-1"}
