{"name": "Chapter 20", "summary": "The herb-doctor runs into the coughing miser who gave Tassel the $100. The miser is in a panic looking for Tassel.<PARAGRAPH>When the miser sees the herb-doctor, he realizes this is the guy Tassel had mentioned. The miser verifies his identity, and the herb-doctor is delighted to help search for Tassel--or John Thurman, as he calls him. Another name. Woot.<PARAGRAPH>The herb-doctor walks the miser around and around on the boat until catching sight of Thurman. The miser doesn't see him, but he follows close behind the herb-doctor as he calls for him.<PARAGRAPH>According to the herb-doctor's singular perspective, we get this: Oh, no, the boat is docking. Oh, no, Thurman is getting off the ship. Oh, no, the ship is heading back out again. Too bad, so sad.<PARAGRAPH>The herb-doctor tells the miser he wishes they could have caught Thurman so that the miser could invest. The miser repeats that he already has invested but needs a receipt. The herb-doctor is thrilled and says pish-posh to receipts--Thurman's got your back.<PARAGRAPH>The herb-doctor leads the miser back to his room, and they discuss the miser's cough. The miser buys a box of herbs, but he tries to cheat the herb-doctor by giving him Spanish coins of low value.<PARAGRAPH>The herb-doctor accepts the coins but tells the miser he hopes he isn't faking a cough to get discounted medicine.<PARAGRAPH>Anyway, the herb-doctor has to go now, because he's getting off the ship that night.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20211017011430/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/confidence-man/summary/chapter-20"}
