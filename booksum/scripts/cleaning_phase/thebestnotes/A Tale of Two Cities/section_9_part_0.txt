{"name": "chapter four: congratulatory", "summary": "After the trial, Dr. Manette, Lucie Manette, Mr. Lorry, and Mr. Stryver stand around Charles Darnay congratulating him \non his acquittal. Dr. Manette, with his intellectual face and upright figure, no longer looks like the shoemaker of the \ngarret in Paris. However, if that past time is ever mentioned, his spirit becomes clouded with a gloomy fit of abstraction. \nOnly his daughter has the power to charm away the dark brooding from his mind.<PARAGRAPH>Darnay kisses Lucie's hand warmly and gratefully and turns to thank Mr. Stryver. Dr. Manette suddenly looks at Darnay \nwith dislike and distrust. Since the Doctor is tired, Lucie takes him home. Mr. Lorry also departs. Sydney Carton \napproaches Darnay and asks him how it feels to be looking at his double, referring to himself. Darnay responds that he \nonly feels faint from the trial. Mr. Carton suggests that he should get something to eat and escorts him to a tavern.<PARAGRAPH>Darnay thanks Mr. Carton for his timely aid even though he is starting to \n        dislike this coarse double of himself. Mr. Carton also dislikes Darnays \n        attention to Lucie since he too is attracted to her. At the tavern, Mr. \n        Carton drinks too much, making Darnay uncomfortable. He pays the bill \n        and prepares to leave. Before he departs, Mr. Carton tells Darnay that \n        he is alone in the world; he cares for no one, and no one cares for him. \n        When he is by himself in the tavern, Carton drinks some more wine and \n        falls asleep on his arms.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Dickens/A_Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Study_Guide12.html"}
