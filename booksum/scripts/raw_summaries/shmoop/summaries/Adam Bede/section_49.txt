{"name": "Chapter 50", "summary": "Adam and Dinah approach the Bede cottage. They're talking, mostly about Dinah's desire to do good works and \"find the fullness of the Divine Presence\" (50.3). Not quite a lovers' topic, but what can you do?<PARAGRAPH>But when Adam talks of what a blessing Dinah's company is, the poor lass blushes to \"a deep rose-colour\" (50.5). Still, they talk of distant things, Arthur's self-imposed exile, the stories in the Bible and which ones they like best. Soon they're at the cottage.<PARAGRAPH>Now, don't get us wrong, Lisbeth couldn't be happier to see Dinah. Yet she's a sharp old bird; she notices that Dinah's \"been a-cryin'\" (50.19). But instead of interrogating Dinah, she kindly and quietly takes Dinah's hand in hers.<PARAGRAPH>While they're having their heart-to-heart, Adam and Seth are sitting in another part of the house. Adam is working at his plans and \"figures.\" What else can he do? He's convinced that his chance at happiness has fled, that there is no future for him \"but one made up of hard-working days such as he lived through\" (50.28).<PARAGRAPH>Yet Adam's mind wanders to Dinah and \"his wish that she had accepted Seth\" (50.30). If Adam is still melancholy about this, just imagine how Seth must feel.<PARAGRAPH>At 5:00 the next morning, Dinah is bustling about the house, \"bringing everything to a pitch of cleanliness and order that would have satisfied her Aunt Poyser\" (50.31).<PARAGRAPH>But she makes the mistake of trying to move some of Adam's papers. Seth, thank heavens, is there to warn her before Adam's beloved papers get completely mixed up. And Adam takes a jovial view of things when he comes down for breakfast.<PARAGRAPH>Adam helps Dinah tidy up a little. He's decided to \"say no more\" about their love, which is becoming a painful subject (50.46). And yet, Eliot's narrator intrudes to tell us all that \"love is a great and beautiful thing\" that has its beginnings in tiny moments (50.47). Like this one, Adam and Dinah cleaning up some papers.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210630082925/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/adam-bede/summary/chapter-50"}
