{"name": "volume 2, Chapter 13", "summary": "Chapter 13: One day, observing the activities of the cottagers as usual, the monster sees something completely out of the ordinary. Two figures, an Arabian beauty and her guide, pull up to the cabin on a horse. Soon it becomes obvious that Felix and the Arabian know each other, though they speak different languages. Everyone seems elated at the reunion of the young couple, who appear to be romantically entwined. In efforts to educate the young Arabian, named Safie, the cottagers read to her Ruins of Empiresover the next few days. Frankenstein's monster uses this as an opportunity to learn about human culture and history as well. Here, the monster shows a unique ability to analyze humanity because, though he's not a human himself, he has the intelligence of one. He explains, \"I heard about the slothful Asiatics; of the stupendous genius and mental activity of the Grecians; of the wars and wonderful virtue of the early Romans-of their subsequent degenerating-of the decline of that mighty empire; of chivalry, Christianity, and kings. This synopsis of Western culture in a nutshell shows the monster's ability to put humanity in perspective. Indeed, there's almost a triviality to it. Yet this education only furthers the monster's realization that he is disconnected from the humans he admires. When he learns that the most respected men in society have wealth and influence, he laments, \"I possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property. Indeed, we feel pity for the creature and understanding of his view of humanity-its good and bad points. In many ways, Shelley uses this passage to underscore the theme of man's cruelty and injustice", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200927043357/https://www.novelguide.com/frankenstein/summaries/chap13-14"}
