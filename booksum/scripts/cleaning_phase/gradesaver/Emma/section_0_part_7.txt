{"name": "volume 1, Chapter 7", "summary": "PARAGRAPH>Chapter Seven: Mr. Martin sends letter to Harriet in which he proposes marriage. Although Emma admits that the letter is better than she expected, she still speaks ill of the letter to Harriet. Emma ultimately dissuades Harriet from accepting the proposal, claiming that a woman should always say no if there is even the slightest doubt. Harriet is disappointed to reject Mr. Martin, but she cedes to Emma's wishes. Emma encourages her to rid herself of thoughts of Mr. Martin and instead think of Mr. Elton getting her portrait framed in London. PARAGRAPH>Analysis: Emma continues to disparage Robert Martin because of his lack of manners, but considering evidence to the contrary , she still reinforces the idea that he is uncouth to Harriet. The idea that one of his sisters wrote the letter is absurd , and Emma promoting the idea is borderline malicious. Emma's interest is not in Robert Martin's manners, but his status. PARAGRAPH>The chapter also reinforces the dynamics of Emma's relationship with Harriet Smith. Harriet depends on Emma for all of her opinions and decisions and cannot decide whether or not to marry Robert Martin without first getting Emma's approval. They have a friendship, but it is not one between equals. It is particularly important that Harriet Smith asks Emma for her opinion even though Harriet obviously has her own concrete opinion on the matter. She may have some doubt but is clearly disappointed when Emma advises her to reject Robert Martin. Still, Harriet does not have the strength to go against Emma's opinion", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419020931/http://www.gradesaver.com/emma/study-guide/summary-chapters-1-7"}
