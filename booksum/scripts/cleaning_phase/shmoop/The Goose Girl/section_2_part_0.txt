{"name": "Chapter 3", "summary": "As Ani prepares to leave her home country, she talks to Selia about what's happened. Selia is outraged, of course, but there isn't really anything Ani can do about it.<PARAGRAPH>Who knows? This might end up being a good thing--Ani can decide who she wants to be, and Selia will get to come with her too.<PARAGRAPH>One day Ani meets up with her bro Calib, who is a little nervous around her--she tells him not to worry, though. Sure, she was bummed at first to leave, but now she's used to the idea--in other words, no harm, no foul.<PARAGRAPH>As she's leaving, the queen makes a big speech about how precious her daughter Ani is, and how she wants everyone to protect her on the journey. She even gives Ani a special handkerchief passed down from her grandma, stained with her mom's blood; it will protect her out in the woods, on the journey to Bayern.<PARAGRAPH>At first Ani's touched, but then she's not sure if her mom is doing this all for show or not.<PARAGRAPH>No matter, though--they're off. Ani and her entourage make a beeline for the forest--it's a long journey to Bayern, but at least Selia seems excited to get the show on the road. Hmm... wonder what's put a spring in her step.<PARAGRAPH>Out in the woods, everyone seems a bit on edge, but not Falada; soon Ani realizes she should just to listen to her horse when it comes to figuring out the trees and animals around her.<PARAGRAPH>One night Falada tells Ani that wolves are coming toward the camp. Ani warns everyone, then sure enough a wolf comes toward them--an archer kills it, though.<PARAGRAPH>No one seems grateful to the young princess at all. In fact, everyone is surprised and a little creeped out that she knew wolves were coming that way. Gee, some thanks she gets for saving their lives.<PARAGRAPH>A few days later, still on the road, Ani catches Selia and some of the guards joking around. When she asks what's funny though, they all shut her out--she's not sure what's going on, but something is definitely happening between Selia and the guards.<PARAGRAPH>So Ani talks to Talone instead. He's the guy who rescued her when she was outside with the swans and fell asleep in the cold, so he must be trustworthy.<PARAGRAPH>There are still weeks of traveling ahead before they are supposed to arrive at Bayern, and Falada is tired from the journey.<PARAGRAPH>When some of the group is off bathing or getting water, Ishta starts talking to Ani in a really creepy way. She doesn't like Talone being around her because he makes her skin crawl, and she's not sure whom she can trust.<PARAGRAPH>Selia returns, cold and wet from bathing in the cold stream, and Ani tells her to bathe in the camp--like she does--but Selia mocks her. Who would heat her water? No one cares about her like they do about Ani.<PARAGRAPH>Ani tells her not to worry, though, because soon they'll be in Bayern, where hot water and warm beds await them both.<PARAGRAPH>Strangely, Selia replies by saying that even more than that awaits her in Bayern...", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20211207010412/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/the-goose-girl/summary/chapter-3"}
