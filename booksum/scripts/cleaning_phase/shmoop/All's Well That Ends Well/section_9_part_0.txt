But even though I married her, I haven't had sex with her and probably never will. By the way, I've run away and don't plan to come home.

She's holding a new letter from Bertram in her hands.<PARAGRAPH>The lords tell us that Bertram has run away to fight the wars in Italy; they just passed him on the road that leads to Florence.<PARAGRAPH>Helen reads the letter from her husband, which goes like this:<PARAGRAPH>Dear Helen,<PARAGRAPH>Don't ever call me your husband unless you can do the following:  get my ring off my finger, and  have my baby.
