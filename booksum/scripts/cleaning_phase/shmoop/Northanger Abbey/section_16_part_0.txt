But she decides to just be happy in the present and not worry about the future. Catherine has a nice fortune cookie world view.<PARAGRAPH>The Tilneys are leaving soon too, but they invite Catherine to come with them to their home, Northanger Abbey. The title finally makes sense.<PARAGRAPH>Well, Eleanor tries to invite Catherine, but the General barges in and interrupts her and then asks Catherine himself.<PARAGRAPH>The whole family wants her to come, though for varying implicit reasons. The General's reasons are totally ambiguous.<PARAGRAPH>Eleanor and Henry clearly just want their friend/almost girlfriend to visit.<PARAGRAPH>Catherine about dies from joy here. She says that her parents will probably be cool with her going.<PARAGRAPH>The Morlands write back soon with their consent and Catherine thinks about how awesome life is for her lately. The fact that the Tilneys, her favorite people, live in a Gothic abbey is just icing on the cake for her.<PARAGRAPH>Catherine assumes that Northanger Abbey will be just like the places she's read about.
