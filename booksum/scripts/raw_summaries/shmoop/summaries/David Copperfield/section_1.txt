{"name": "Chapter 2", "summary": "The first things David can remember from early childhood are (1) his pretty mother, and (2) Peggotty, his mother's not-so-pretty housekeeper.<PARAGRAPH>He also remembers his house, which had a pigeon-house with no pigeons and a dog kennel with no dogs.<PARAGRAPH>David recalls a series of early sense impressions: of a graveyard covered with mossy grass and the church where he, Peggotty, and his mother go on Sundays.<PARAGRAPH>He remembers sitting in the parlor with his mother.<PARAGRAPH>One night, as David waits up to see his mother when she comes home from an outing, David asks Peggotty if she has ever been married.<PARAGRAPH>Peggotty says no.<PARAGRAPH>David continues: but, if you marry someone and that person dies, then you're allowed to marry someone else?<PARAGRAPH>Peggotty agrees that you can, if you want to.<PARAGRAPH>David thinks that Peggotty is angry with him, but she doesn't seem to be. In fact, she hugs David tightly. He has no idea why Peggotty seems so upset.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, David's mother comes home.<PARAGRAPH>With her is a man with dark hair and a mustache, who speaks in a deep voice that David doesn't trust.<PARAGRAPH>The man insists that David shake his hand, but David really doesn't want to: there's something about this guy that he doesn't like.<PARAGRAPH>The man leaves, and David, Mrs. Copperfield, and Peggotty all head in to the parlor.<PARAGRAPH>Peggotty asks Mrs. Copperfield if she's had a nice evening; Mrs. Copperfield agrees that she has.<PARAGRAPH>David dozes off, and when he wakes up, Peggotty and Mrs. Copperfield are having a bit of an argument.<PARAGRAPH>Peggotty says that Mr. Copperfield wouldn't like \"such a one as this\" (2.49) \u2013 presumably the black-haired man.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Copperfield asks how Peggotty dares to say such unpleasant things to Mrs. Copperfield, when Peggotty knows that Mrs. Copperfield is entirely alone in the world.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Copperfield thinks Peggotty is suggesting that she doesn't love David enough, and turns to David to ask him if she's a bad mother.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Copperfield, Peggotty, and David all burst out crying.<PARAGRAPH>After this, David remembers seeing the dark-haired man more and more, and Peggotty less and less.<PARAGRAPH>David continues to feel resentful and jealous of the dark-haired man. He's not sure why. He's too young to put all the pieces together about what the dark-haired man is doing hanging around his mother all the time.<PARAGRAPH>We find out that this dark-haired man is named Mr. Murdstone.<PARAGRAPH>One day, Mr. Murdstone comes galloping up and offers to take David for a ride.<PARAGRAPH>He takes David down the coast to a hotel, where they meet with two other men, Quinion and Passnidge.<PARAGRAPH>Murdstone and Quinion talk right over David's head about Murdstone's plans to marry David's mother.<PARAGRAPH>David doesn't understand that Murdstone and Quinion are talking about him whenever they refer to \"Brooks of Sheffield.\"<PARAGRAPH>He spends the afternoon not realizing that he's the butt of their jokes about the pretty little widow.<PARAGRAPH>David observes that Mr. Murdstone seems much more serious than his two friends, who both seem a bit afraid of Mr. Murdstone.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Murdstone basically never laughs.<PARAGRAPH>Once David gets home, he tells his mother all about the nice things that Mr. Murdstone, Quinion, and Passnidge said about Mrs. Copperfield's appearance.<PARAGRAPH>She's terribly pleased and flattered.<PARAGRAPH>She doesn't want David to tell Peggotty, in case it will make her angry.<PARAGRAPH>The next day, Peggotty asks David if he wants to come to visit Peggotty's brother at Yarmouth (a seaside town in England).<PARAGRAPH>David's pretty excited at the idea of meeting Peggotty's family and seeing the ocean and fishermen and so on, but he's worried about what his mother will do in his absence.<PARAGRAPH>Peggotty says it's fine; Mrs. Copperfield's staying with a neighbor, Mrs. Grayper, for two weeks.<PARAGRAPH>As they head out to the cart that will carry them away, Mrs. Copperfield kisses David again and again \u2013 she and David have never been parted before.<PARAGRAPH>David and Peggotty climb into the cart.<PARAGRAPH>Over his shoulder, David turns to see Mr. Murdstone standing next to Mrs. Copperfield.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Murdstone seems to be scolding Mrs. Copperfield for being so emotional.<PARAGRAPH>Peggotty observes this scene as well. She looks very unhappy.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200929182814/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/david-copperfield/summary/chapter-2"}
