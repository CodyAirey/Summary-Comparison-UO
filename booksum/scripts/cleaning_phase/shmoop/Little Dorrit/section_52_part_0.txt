Merdle is all meek and weird under-talking.<PARAGRAPH>Still, somehow they manage to exchange some compliments about joining families.<PARAGRAPH>Then Dorrit sneaks in his thoughts about where and how to invest his money.<PARAGRAPH>Merdle offers his own advice and even offers to use his power to get Dorrit into some choice and very selective investments.
