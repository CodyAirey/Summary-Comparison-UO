{"name": "Chapter 30", "summary": "Leaving Volger behind, Alek and the rest of the walker's crew head back to the castle with Dr. Barlow, Dylan, and Tazza.<PARAGRAPH>Dr. Barlow begins selecting food for the beasts, making pointed comments to Alek all the while that indicate she totally knows who he is.<PARAGRAPH>They all load up the food on a huge sleigh that the walker will pull back to the Leviathan.<PARAGRAPH>Alek and Dylan give each other a hard time about Darwinists versus Clankers, but they really are becoming good friends.<PARAGRAPH>Alek accidentally mentions he's an orphan and asks Dylan not to tell anyone in case they figure out who he really is--Dylan doesn't know who he really is though, so doesn't press the issue or even really know to press the issue in the first place. Alek realizes Dylan is the first person he's trusted in a long time.<PARAGRAPH>Because there's no reason to hide the smoke now, they all have a hot dinner and Alek and the other men take warm baths; Dr. Barlow and Dylan decline the tub.<PARAGRAPH>The next morning, they start out for the Leviathan, dragging the sleigh behind the walker.<PARAGRAPH>They see two airships coming over the mountains. At first, everyone thinks they're airbeasts, but then they realize they're German zeppelins, coming to finish the Leviathan off.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210507031130/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/leviathan/summary/chapter-30"}
