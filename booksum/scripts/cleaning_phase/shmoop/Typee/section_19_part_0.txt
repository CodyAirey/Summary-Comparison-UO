After, Tommo sails around the lake with Fayaway, or goes swimming, then watches the young women dance.<PARAGRAPH>At last, he returns to the house of Marheyo, to eat a bit, smoke a bit, and go back to sleep. It sounds like a real grind.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201024203607/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/typee/summary/chapter-20"}
