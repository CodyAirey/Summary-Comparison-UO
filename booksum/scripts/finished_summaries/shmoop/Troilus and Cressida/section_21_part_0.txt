He gives them detailed instructions about how he wants them to surround Hector and then \"impale him\" with their weapons. Next, Menelaus and Paris battle their way across the stage. Thersites follows and yells out stuff like \"Hey, it's the 'cuckold' and 'the cuckold maker' going at it. Get him Paris! Get him!\" Then a guy named Margarelon shows up and challenges Thersites to fight. Thersites is all \"Who the heck are you?\" and Margarelon is all \"A bastard son of Priam's, duh.\" Then Thersites says that, hey, he loves \"bastards,\" being one himself. In fact, \"bastards\" should really try to stick together and stay out of this nasty war.\" Thersites runs away. Are you shocked?", "analysis": ""}
