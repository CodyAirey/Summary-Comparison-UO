{"name": "Chapter 13", "summary": "Chapter 13: Another View of Hester Seven years have passed since Pearl's birth. Hester has become more active in society. She brings food to the doors of the poor, she nurses the sick, and she is a source of aid in times of trouble. She is still frequently made an object of scorn, but more people are beginning to interpret the \"A\" on her chest as meaning \"Able\" rather than \"Adulterer. Hester herself has also changed. She is no longer a tender and passionate woman; rather, burned by the \"red-hot brand\" of the letter, she has become  \"a bare and harsh outline\" of her former self.
