{"name": "Scene 3", "summary": "Biron reads from a soul-searching composition: I will not love; if I do, hang me! I'faith, I will not. O but her eye! . . . By heaven, I do love, and it hath taught me to rhyme and to be melancholy . . . ... When the King enters, a sheet of paper in his hand, Biron ducks out of sight and listens with pleasure as his monarch reads from a sonnet he has written:\nO queen of queens, how far dost thou excel No thought can think, nor tongue of mortal tell! 40\u201341)\nThe comedy builds rapidly with Longaville entering, the King ducking aside, then Dumain coming onto the scene and forcing Longaville into hiding. Each in turn reads from his own lyrical expression of love, unaware of the presence of the others. Then they are exposed in turn, with Biron the last to emerge to accuse the King of hypocrisy for upbraiding Dumain and Longaville, who have broken their vows:\nNow step I forth to whip hypocrisy.Oh, good my liege, I pray thee, pardon me.Good heart, what grace hast thou thus to reproveThese worms for loving, that art most in love? (151\u201354) \nAfter this accusation, Biron also suffers the obligatory embarrassment, because Costard, bearing Biron's missive to Rosaline, has unexpectedly appeared. Jacquenetta asks that the letter be read, because \"our parson [Holofernes] misdoubts it; 'twas treason, he said.\" Biron tries to wriggle free, but Dumain pieces together the shreds of paper which Biron has made of the letter. \n\nDumain: It is Biron's writing, and here is his name. Biron: [to Costard]: Ah, you whoreson loggerhead, you were born to do me shame! Guilty, my lord, guilty. I confess, I confess. \nBiron heartily calls for them all to recognize their folly:\nSweet lords, sweet lovers, O, let us embrace!As true we are as flesh and blood can be.The sea will ebb and flow, heaven show his face; Young blood doth not obey an old decree. (214\u201317)\nJoined by Dumain and Longaville, the King enters a genteel slanging match with Biron over the relative merits of their preferred women. At the Kings request,\nBut what of this? Are we not all in love? . . .Then leave this chat, and, good Biron, now proveOur loving lawful and our faith not torn, (282\u201384)\nBiron rationalizes their unanimous (though independently arrived at) choice to countermand the vows of chastity:\nTo fast, to study, and to see no woman Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth. (292\u201393)\nThe scene ends in jubilation as the King bids them all prepare some entertainment with which to woo their ladies. They all agree with Biron:\nIn the afternoonWe will with some strange pastime solace them,Such as the shortness of the time can shape;For revels, dances, masks, and merry hoursForerun fair Love, strewing her way with flowers. (376\u201380)", "analysis": "Scene 3 is a classical piece of comedy. Each of the young men is exposed, while the audience enjoys the process of their mutual deceit leading up to the final moment. Following the conventions of Elizabethan staging, one must imagine each of the lovers hiding from the others while in full view of the audience. It is simply accepted dramatically that when they speak their \"asides\" to the audience, the main \"onstage\" character doesn't hear them. Biron is most likely tucked away in the tiring house (the rear wall) facade or placed in a practicable stage property tree (\"like a demigod here sit I in the sky\") while he looks down on the foolishness of his peers. The others are distributed about the stage.\nNotice the style of each \"love sonnet\": the Kings opens conventionally with the syrup of courtly love:\nSo sweet a kiss the golden sun gives notTo those fresh morning drops upon the rose,As thy eye-beams when their fresh rays have smoteThe night of dew that on my cheeks down flows. (26\u201329)\nThen it \"progresses\" to lovers! melancholy:\nBut do not love thyself \u2014 then thou will keep My tears for glasses [mirrors] and still make me weep. (38\u201339)\nLongaville engages in sophistry, intellectually justifying his aberrance:\nA woman I forswore, but I will prove, Thou being a goddess, I forswore not thee. (64\u201365)\nThis remark elicits Biron's ironic judgment from \"on high\": \"Pure, pure idolatry./God amend us, God amend!\" It is ironic because Biron is a past-master at just this sort of intellectual conceit.\nDumain's attempt is the least accomplished, though his intent is the same as the others:\nOn a day \u2014 alack the day! \u2014 Love, whose month is ever May,Spied a blossom passing fairPlaying in the wanton air. . . .Do not call it sin in me,That I am forsworn for thee. (101\u20136)\nHis \"private wish\" is no sooner uttered than he discovers that it has been true all along:\nO, would the King, Biron, and Longaville Were lovers too! (123\u201324)\nThe greatest fall is amusingly reserved for the man whose position is most haughty. Biron lays it on thick when he berates his fellows:\nI that am honest, I that hold it sinTo break the vow I am engaged in;I am betrayed by keeping companyWith men like you, men of inconstancy.\nWhen shall you see me write a thing in rhyme? Or groan for love? (177\u201382)\nThe tone of the scene is jolly, however, and the satire is not calculated to \"draw blood,\" as was true for hypocrites attacked by Shakespeare's contemporary, Ben Jonson, or would be true in Moliere's great comedies of the seventeenth century. The four lovers playfully attack one another, boyishly teasing each other about the virtues of their ladies: \n\nBiron: Your mistresses dare never come in rain, For fear their colours should be washed away. King: 'Twere good yours did; for, sir, to tell you plain, I'll find a fairer face not washed today. Biron: I'll prove her fair or talk till doomsday here. (270\u201374) \nThe seventy-line \"justification\" uttered by Biron at the end of the scene offers a special insight into Shakespeare's process of composing his early plays. In most editions of the play, this section beginning with \"And where that you have vowed to study, lords!' and concluding with \"Do we not likewise see our learning there?\" will be bracketed, or set apart as redundant. The fact is, these lines are essentially no different from the following ones, indicating that Shakespeare re-cast the thoughts into sharper poetical language. His printer probably overlooked the deletion and set both sections of the speech. Compare the two passages for effectiveness.\nBiron sings the praises of love as a teacher and a spur to intellectual and creative energy. He claims that it gives \"to every power a double power,\" compared to \"slow arts\" (mere book-learning) which \"scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil.\" His peroration deservedly earns the accolade of his King.\nThen fools you were these women to forswear,Or, keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.For wisdom's sake, a word that all men love,Or for love's sake, a word that loves all men,Or for men's sake, the authors of these women,Or women's sake, by whom we men are menLet us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths. (355\u201362)\nFittingly, the King declares a new allegiance to usher the men to follow the urgings of their passion and to draw the scene to a close:\nSaint Cupid then! And, soldiers, to the field!
