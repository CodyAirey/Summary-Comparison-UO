On their way back, they find a cart full of bricks that's stuck in the mud, with the carter \"shouting and flogging the two horses unmercifully\" . Uh-uh...

Joe urges Beauty to the nearby house of the brick maker, where he reports this incident.<PARAGRAPH>When they get home, John is shocked at Joe's anger and tells the boy he did the right thing.<PARAGRAPH>Later on, Joe is called up to Squire Gordon's house to give evidence against the man who'd whipped the horses.
