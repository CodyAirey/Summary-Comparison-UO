{"name": "Chapter 25", "summary": "Having been able to observe the Typee people as a whole for the first time at the festival, Tommo comes to a few conclusions, particularly that pretty much everyone seems to be beautiful and able-bodied. Even the aged have good teeth!<PARAGRAPH>Where Nukuheva men were bad-looking, and the women good, Tommo believes that the \"uncontaminated\" (25.7) Typee are wholly attractive, no matter the gender.<PARAGRAPH>Tommo talks about the various tones of complexion in the native people, as well as the \"papa\" root some females use to lighten their skin.<PARAGRAPH>He notes that explorers before him, since the sixteenth century, have written about the peoples' rare beauty.<PARAGRAPH>There are few European items in the valley, limited to things like the cotton Tommo himself brought and an old British musket in disrepair.<PARAGRAPH>As far as he can tell, Tommo says, everyone in the valley seems fairly laid-back most of the time, with those in power mixing with those not, and markers of power or class rarely visible at all.<PARAGRAPH>The one exception to this is Mehevi, and Tommo is grateful to this royal chief's good graces.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201024203607/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/typee/summary/chapter-25"}
