{"name": "Scene 3", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820050202/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmTroilus53.asp", "summary": "Enter Paris and Troilus with Aeneas, Deiphobus, Antenor and Diomedes Paris tells Troilus to tell Cressida what she is to do and to hasten her to the purpose. Paris does as he is bid albeit with some reluctance. After he exits, Paris commiserates and says that he knows what it is like to be in love and wishes he could help.", "analysis": "Notes This is a linking scene and gives the audience a further glimpse of Troilus depth of feeling when he tells Paris he will deliver Cressida to Diomedes and adds: And to his hand when I deliver her, /Think it an altar, and thy brother Troilus/A priest, there offring to it his own heart. Given that we have seen the object of Paris affections, his comment: I know what tis to love... seems to undercut Troilus but this is not explicit."}
