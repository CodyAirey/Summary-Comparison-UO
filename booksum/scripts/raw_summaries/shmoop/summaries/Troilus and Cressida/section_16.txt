{"name": "Act 5, Scene 2", "summary": "Diomedes shows up at the tent looking for Cressida.<PARAGRAPH>Calchas invites him inside as Troilus and Ulysses watch from a distance and Thersites creeps up behind them to see what happens.<PARAGRAPH>Cressida is all coy with Diomedes, calling him her \"sweet guardian\" and her \"sweet honey Greek\" and begging him not to \"tempt\" her as he whispers in her ear.<PARAGRAPH>Diomedes reminds Cressida that she promised she would give him something. (Uh-oh. Things aren't looking good for Troilus.)<PARAGRAPH>Troilus is crushed but he refuses to budge, even when Ulysses says he should just go home and forget about Cressida.<PARAGRAPH>Thersites,who's watching this scene from his own vantage point, is thoroughly disgusted with both Cressida and Diomedes. But then, Thersites seems pretty disgusted with everybody.<PARAGRAPH>Eventually, Cressida promises to sleep with Diomedes and even gives him a love token to prove she's serious. Guess what it is?<PARAGRAPH>That's right. The \"sleeve\" Troilus gave her earlier.<PARAGRAPH>This just about kills Troilus, obviously.<PARAGRAPH>Diomedes wants to know where the love token came from but Cressida won't tell.<PARAGRAPH>Then she changes her mind and says she's not going to hook up with Diomedes and that he shouldn't come back to her tent.<PARAGRAPH>Diomedes threatens to wear the sleeve the next day during battle just to taunt the guy who gave it to Cressida.<PARAGRAPH>As he turns to leave, Cressida tells him to wait up. She's changed her mind again and has decided to sleep with him after all.<PARAGRAPH>Diomedes has had enough of this crazy lady and leaves.<PARAGRAPH>But Cressida claims she can't help the fact that she's unfaithful because she's a woman and all women are promiscuous.<PARAGRAPH>With that lovely thought, she exits the stage.<PARAGRAPH>Thersites, who has been making nasty comments the whole time, says that Cressida is a \"whore.\"<PARAGRAPH>Troilus can't believe what he's just seen and heard, and he declares that he's going to stab Diomedes tomorrow during battle. Which is logical. Not.<PARAGRAPH>Then Aeneas shows up and announces that Hector has already gone back to Troy and it's time for Troilus to go home, too.<PARAGRAPH>Thersites is left alone on stage. He says that the world is all about \"lechery, lechery, still wars and lechery.\" We feel you, man.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219191630/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/troilus-cressida/summary/act-5-scene-2"}
