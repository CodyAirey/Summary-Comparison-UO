89. NJAL'S SONS AND KARI COME OUT TO ICELAND

That summer Kari and Njal's sons busked them for Iceland, and
when they were "all-boun" they went to see the earl.  The earl
gave them good gifts, and they parted with great friendship.

Now they put to sea and have a short passage, and they got a fine
fair breeze, and made the land at Eyrar.  Then they got them
horses and ride from the ship to Bergthorsknoll, but when they
came home all men were glad to see them.  They flitted home their
goods and laid up the ship, and Kari was there that winter with
Njal.

But the spring after, Kari asked for Njal's daughter, Helga, to
wife, and Helgi and Grim backed his suit; and so the end of it
was that she was betrothed to Kari and the day for the wedding-
feast was fixed, and the feast was held half a month before
mid-summer, and they were that winter with Njal.

Then Kari bought him land at Dyrholms, east away by Mydale, and
set up a farm there; they put in there a grieve and housekeeper
to see after the farm, but they themselves were ever with Njal.
