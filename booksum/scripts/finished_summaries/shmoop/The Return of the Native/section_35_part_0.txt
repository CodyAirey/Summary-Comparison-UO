Eustacia is hanging around outside in her garden, as usual, and Humphrey stops by to ask after Clym. Clym is still inconsolable. Eustacia goes inside to speak to Clym. He's super depressed. Eustacia still hasn't said a word to him about not letting his mom in for a visit that day. The two talk in circles since all Clym can, or wants, to talk about is how guilty he feels and how wonderful his mom was. Clym wallows and Eustacia stews. Then Thomasin stops by for a visit. Clym goes on a shame-spiral rant, which really worries Thomasin. Eustacia remains pretty quiet through the whole thing. We learn that Thomasin is going to have her baby in another two months. Clym just won't stop talking and is obsessed about why his mother said what she did to Johnny before she died. Finally Damon pulls up in his carriage to pick up Thomasin. Eustacia rushes out to speak to him about her own guilt, since Clym is hogging the guilt spotlight at home. Damon offers up stupid advice, like not telling Clym he was in the house when Mrs. Yeobright came to visit. He then wishes that Clym would just die already and Eustacia gets mad at him. Thomasin comes out and the Wildeves drive off, with Eustacia watching them from the window.", "analysis": ""}
