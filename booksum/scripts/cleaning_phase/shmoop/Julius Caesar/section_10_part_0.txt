{"name": "Act 4, Scene 1", "summary": "Antony, Octavius, and Lepidus are gathered with a checklist of the men they plan to murder for conspiracy. Lepidus agrees that his brother can be killed as long as Antony agrees for his nephew to be killed.<PARAGRAPH>Lepidus is sent to collect Caesar's will, to see if they can divert some of his money their way.<PARAGRAPH>As soon as Lepidus has gone, Antony begins to  talk trash about him. Antony thinks Lepidus is weak, so it's a shame that he'll be sharing power with Antony and Octavius in the triumvirate.  Antony says he only took Lepidus' word about who should die because he's more experienced than Octavius.<PARAGRAPH>The plan is to let Lepidus bear the burden of ruling while doing as he's told by the other two.<PARAGRAPH>Octavius is more in the pro-Lepidus camp and insists that he's a good solider. Antony replies that his  horse is a good soldier too - good at being led and ordered. To them, Lepidus should only be a puppet.<PARAGRAPH>They then discuss the fact that Brutus and Cassius are raising an army, which they have to fight by allying their friends and funds.<PARAGRAPH>They go off to sit in council and discuss how they'll fight their enemies and  weed out the traitors.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210421200255/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/julius-caesar/summary/act-4-scene-1"}
