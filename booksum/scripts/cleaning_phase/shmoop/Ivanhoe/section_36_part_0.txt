{"name": "Chapter 36", "summary": "This chapter's epigraph is another passage from that fictional \"Old Play\" Scott uses as a cover for his own poetry.

But of course, it's because Rebecca is a witch!<PARAGRAPH>Albert also explains that he only brought Rebecca here because the holiness of this place would stop them from breaking Bois-Guilbert's vow of chastity.<PARAGRAPH>Albert reminds him that they don't want to lose Bois-Guilbert, since he's been so strong in the Crusades.<PARAGRAPH>Beaumanoir's anti-Semitism and hatred of women makes him eager to pick Rebecca as the sole target of his anger. He resolves to judge and condemn her for witchcraft.<PARAGRAPH>Albert slips away to talk to Bois-Guilbert.<PARAGRAPH>Bois-Guilbert is furious because Rebecca absolutely refuses to have sex with him.<PARAGRAPH>Albert is mad because Bois-Guilbert could have tons of women less difficult than Rebecca.<PARAGRAPH>Albert tells Bois-Guilbert that Beaumanoir knows Rebecca is at Templestowe.<PARAGRAPH>Albert says there's no way for Bois-Guilbert to rescue her.<PARAGRAPH>Bois-Guilbert doesn't want to let Rebecca die. But he also doesn't want to give up his position and honor as a Knight Templar.<PARAGRAPH>The trial is set to begin immediately - Beaumanoir doesn't want to waste any time in condemning Rebecca.<PARAGRAPH>Beaumanoir's friend Conrade tells Albert to find more damaging proof of Rebecca's guilt - even if he has to make it up.<PARAGRAPH>If Albert helps Beaumanoir convict Rebecca, he'll get a better posting in the south of England.<PARAGRAPH>Albert goes to bribe Philip Malvoisin and his followers to testify against Rebecca.<PARAGRAPH>When the guards arrive at Rebecca's room, she's happy to see them.<PARAGRAPH>She thinks that if she can just explain everything to a judge she will be free of Bois-Guilbert.<PARAGRAPH>As she walks into the main hall, someone stuffs a paper into her hand.<PARAGRAPH>She doesn't read the message right away. She is just happy to know that she has a friend in the room.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210614173333/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/ivanhoe/summary/chapter-36"}
