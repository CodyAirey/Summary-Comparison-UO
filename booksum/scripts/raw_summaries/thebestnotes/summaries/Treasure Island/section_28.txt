{"name": "chapter 29", "summary": "One of the buccaneers shows \nup later to borrow the light. Silver, by this time, has started talking to Jim \nin a friendly tone. Jim sees the group of buccaneers proceeding towards the stockade. \nUnlike Jim, Silver is hardly concerned. When the door opens, one of the men is \npushed ahead to hand over a piece of paper to Silver. It\u0092s the Black Spot again. \nSilver condemns their act, as he recognizes the paper as having been cut out of \na bible. He taunts Dick for doing this. At this, George is furious and asks Silver \nto do his part of his duty by reading it. He asks Silver to step down from his \nposition for a common note. In the heated conversation that followed, Silver is \naccused of releasing the prisoners and saving the life of Jim.<PARAGRAPH>Now it \nis Silver\u0092s turn to lash out at their arguments and prove his superiority. He \nanswers their arguments one by one. Firstly, he accuses Anderson, Hands, George \nand Davy Jones for crossing him. He goes on to tell them that they will be better \noff as tailors than sailors. As for Jim, he says he is a hostage and killing him \nwould be a waste. He reminds them about the consort. He also reminds them that \nhe was the one who bargained for food without which they would have been, by now, \ncrawling on the floor.<PARAGRAPH>Much to their surprise, he then throws the original \ntreasure map in front of them. The men are dumb founded. Silver gives a final \nwarning to George and asks him to shut his mouth if he wants to live. To prove \nhis supremacy once again, Silver asks who the Captain is.<PARAGRAPH>Silver throws \nthe piece of paper to Jim. The paper contains two verses of the Bible. This is \nblackened with wood ash which soiled out as Jim took it in his hand. `Deposed\u0092 \nwas written on the blank side. Jim is unable to comprehend any thing. That ends \nthe night\u0092s activity. Jim lies down admiring the remarkable tactics Silver used \nto control the mutineers and save his life.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Treasure_Island/Treasure_Island33.html"}
