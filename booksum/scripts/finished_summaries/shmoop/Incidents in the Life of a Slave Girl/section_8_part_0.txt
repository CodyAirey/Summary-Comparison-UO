Exhibit A: Mr. Litch tortures his slaves through starvation, physical torture, and, sometimes, murder. His brother is no better. When a slave runs away, he lets his bloodhounds loose to tear the flesh from his bones. Exhibit B: Mr. Conant punishes a slave by tying him a tree, whipping him, and leaving him to freeze to death in winter. Exhibit C: Mrs. Wade beats her slaves all day, from morning to night. Sure, some slaveholders are very kind. Like, there was this one female slaveholder who treated her slaves like family. Buuut.... she ended up marrying a very mean man who raped the female slaves. And you'd better believe all this is true. Linda is speaking from personal experience and twenty-one years of observation. The moral of this chapter? The institution of slavery is a curse to whites and blacks alike.", "analysis": ""}
