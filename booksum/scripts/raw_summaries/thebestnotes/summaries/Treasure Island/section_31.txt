{"name": "chapter 32", "summary": "The \nmen are exhausted by the time they reach the plateau. So they rest for a while. \nTalking in soft tones they discuss Flint and his men. Suddenly from the middle \nof the trees, the famous song of Billy Bones are heard.<PARAGRAPH>\"Fifteen \nmen on the dead man's chest-Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!\"<PARAGRAPH>Jim says, \nhe had never seen the six men more terrified. The song stops. Silver tries to \nrecognize the voice. Once again the voice breaks out. This time, instead of the \nsong it says \"Darby McGrow\". Dick takes out his Bible and starts praying. \nBut Silver is still not disturbed. He says that he is here to get the seven hundred \nthousand pounds from the Island and that he shall get it. This doesn\u0092t charge \nup this crew. Morgan feels that it is the spirit\u0092s voice and stops Silver from \ncrossing it. Silver reasons out that spirit\u0092s voice doesn\u0092t echo and that it is \nhuman. Nudging his memory, Silver cries out that its Ben Gunn. Soon they are back \nin their original spirits. Without minding the presence of Ben Gunn, they proceed \ntowards the treasure. Dick is still terrified and Silver\u0092s taunt terrifies him \nmore.<PARAGRAPH>They reach the first of the tall trees and then the second and the \nthird. Jim says the only thing that kept them going was the thought of the seven \nhundred thousand pounds. Finally they reach the edge of the thicket. Overjoyed, \nthey shout `huzza\u0092. All of a sudden Silver increases his pace. Jim follows him. \nThey stop when they see the most unexpected sight.<PARAGRAPH>The treasure has gone. It has already been excavated and the only thing that is \nleft is the nameplate of Flint\u0092s ship - WALRUS.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Treasure_Island/Treasure_Island36.html"}
