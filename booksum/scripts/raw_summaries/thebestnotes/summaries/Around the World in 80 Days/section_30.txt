{"name": "chapter 26", "summary": "The railway between New York and San Francisco is \ndescribed along with the politics of it. The long artery, which has to be traversed \nin seven days to reach New York, is outlined. Then the train carriages are interestingly \ndetailed.<PARAGRAPH>Passepartout and Fix are now distanced from each other. Passepartout \nis reserved and suspicious of Fix\u2019s trickery. For some time, the train journey \nis absolutely smooth and nothing extraordinary happens. The landscape that they \nare passing through is outlined. The travelers observe nature around them. There \nare vast prairies, mountains standing out on the horizon, and creeks with their \nseething, foaming waters. At three o\u2019clock in the afternoon, a herd of ten or \ntwelve thousand head of buffalo block the way. The train had to be stopped till \nthe animals move out of the way. Passepartout was furious at the delay and wanted \nthe engine driver to go at full speed, through these obstructing beasts. But the \nengine driver was sensible in not taking such a drastic step.<PARAGRAPH>The march \nof the bisons lasted three hours; after which the train started and then entered \nthe territory of Utah, the curious land of Great Salt Lake and the Mormons.<PARAGRAPH>Notes\nIn this Chapter, a part of the journey on the Pacific \nExpress is covered. Verne does have a very wide bank of knowledge and here we \nsee how he describes the American railway system. He includes the role of history \nin his narrative. We learn that Fogg will have to travel seven days, before reaching \nNew York. Unlike the other chapters, in this chapter ordinary actions are described \nsuch as passengers resting at bedtime. In the immediately preceding chapters, \nthere was much happening and life seemed extraordinary. In this chapter, we return \npartly to the every day, routine life. The train moves through vivid scenery, \nwhich all the passengers watch animatedly.<PARAGRAPH>The only extraordinary incident \nin this chapter is the presence of a large number of bisons that obstruct the \ntrain\u2019s journey. They are on the tracks and are so many that the train has to \nbe stopped. This was a genuine problem for many a train in America. We see how \nimpatient Passepartout can be. He is comical in most of his emotions and expressions. \nHe curses the animals and wants the train driver to run over them. On the other \nhand Fogg is as calm as always and does not betray any impatience in the frustrating \nsituation. The two characters-the master and the valet have absolutely opposing \nmindsets.<PARAGRAPH>The train driver is rational and does a wise thing in not bulldozing \nhis way through the beasts. The train does move on finally and the passengers \nare once more on their way to New York.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141554/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Around_The_World_In_80_Days/Around_The_World_In_Eighty_Days26.html"}
