So that's a bit of a comedown.<PARAGRAPH>Alek tries to sneak up on Volger, who is listening to Morse code over the wireless.<PARAGRAPH>Nobody sneaks up on Volger, though.<PARAGRAPH>Volger tells Alek that the army is preparing for war--or so he thinks, due to increased traffic on the wireless.<PARAGRAPH>Alek hopes this means everyone has forgotten about him. Volger says not a chance: Alek is super duper important, and no one would forget about wanting him dead. Comforting guy, that Volger.<PARAGRAPH>And then Volger stops spilling information and goes back to being Count Mysterious.<PARAGRAPH>Because they're both a bit annoyed at each other, Volger suggests a fencing lesson--nothing says relaxation quite like pointing a sharp object at someone who is getting on your nerves, after all.<PARAGRAPH>During the fencing lesson, Volger and Alek discuss international politics, outlining the way the great powers of Europe will ally with each other in the coming war.<PARAGRAPH>They conclude by figuring out that the Darwinist powers will fight the Clanker powers.<PARAGRAPH>Alek feels that the war is in some way his fault because no one wanted his parents' marriage or his birth, and now his parents' deaths are leading to war.<PARAGRAPH>Volger tells Alek he may still have a chance to influence the war, though of course he's very enigmatic about how.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210507031130/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/leviathan/summary/chapter-9"}
