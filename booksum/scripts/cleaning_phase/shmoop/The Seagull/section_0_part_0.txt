He's particularly afraid of his mother Arkadina's criticism. She's a famous actress and doesn't take well to other people's work.<PARAGRAPH>Nina enters. She's starring in Konstantin's play. They're in love with each other.<PARAGRAPH>Nina is anxious because the renowned writer Trigorin will be watching.
