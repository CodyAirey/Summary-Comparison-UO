When the scene opens, Justice Shallow is being a good host and insists that Falstaff spend the night instead of travelling on to London.<PARAGRAPH>Falstaff does the \"aw shucks\" routine and pretends he doesn't want to impose. <PARAGRAPH>When Shallow's servant, Davy, enters with some papers, Shallow does a little multitasking. He attends to some household issues, like giving orders for the preparation of dinner, while Davy pesters him about some local legal issues involving some of his friends.<PARAGRAPH>Davy asks Justice Shallow  if he would please take it easy on his friend, William Visor, who has gotten into a bit of legal trouble. Shallow reassures his servant that his friend will be okay and sends him on his way.<PARAGRAPH>Shallow says that Falstaff, Bardolph, and the Page are all welcome in his home and leads the group inside. Justice Silence, who has been silent this whole time, tags along.<PARAGRAPH>Falstaff lingers alone on stage for a moment - just long enough to mock Justice Shallow for being a \"foolish justice.\" Shallow is way too nice to his servants and acts just like them. Falstaff can't wait to tell Prince Hal all about the silly old goat - the stories will keep Hal rolling with laughter for a good long time.<PARAGRAPH>Falstaff runs inside when Shallow calls to him.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210119094949/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/henry-iv-part-2/summary/act-5-scene-1"}
