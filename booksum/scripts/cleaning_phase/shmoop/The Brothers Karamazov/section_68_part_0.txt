Kolya returns to the room and the doctor leaves in a huff.<PARAGRAPH>Snegiryov tries to reassure Ilyusha, but Ilyusha already knows that nothing can be done and that there's no cure. He pulls both Kolya and Snegiryov to his tiny, consumptive body in a hug.<PARAGRAPH>Everybody is crying at this point.
