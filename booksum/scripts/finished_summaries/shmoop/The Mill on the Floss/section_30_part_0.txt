She has a lot of inner turmoil and is torn between her own internal longings and the outward realities that limit her life. Mr. Tulliver is recovered and is back at work as the Mill's manager. Mr. Wakem is now his boss. Tom is working for Mr. Deane still and is exhausted. Mrs. Tulliver is depressed and bewildered and throws herself into mothering Maggie and Tom since she doesn't know what else to do. Maggie is most upset by her father's depression, though. The only thing her father takes a real interest in is counting the money that he keeps in a lock-box. Tom contributes most of his wages to the family fund. The Tullivers have a very strict view of debt and they live on the smallest budge possible in order to save up the money to pay off their debts quickly. Maggie is depressed because both her father and Tom ignore her and the whole household is chronically in a bad mood. The family has very few visitors and each day passes like the one before. It's a very bleak existence for the Tullivers.", "analysis": ""}
