{"name": "Chapter 6", "summary": "The Time Traveller knows that he should investigate the Morlocks, but he doesn't want to because they're disgusting. They are, he says, \"filthily cold\" . We're not entirely sure what that means, but it sure sounds gross.<PARAGRAPH>He avoids going underground by exploring the surface. He sees a large building far off that looks like it's made of green porcelain and decides to go explore it.<PARAGRAPH>But then he realizes that he's just putting off the inevitable: he needs to go down a well and see how the Morlocks live.<PARAGRAPH>Weena gets upset when she realizes what he's doing, but he does it anyway.<PARAGRAPH>It's a hard climb down, but he finds a tunnel branching off from the well. He hears some machines.<PARAGRAPH>He rests a moment, then feels some Morlock's soft hands touching him, which jolts him. He lights a match to see the Morlock better, but it runs away.<PARAGRAPH>He follows the tunnel and finds a cavern full of machinery. He also smells blood, but that doesn't worry him. There's a table with some meat on it. He wonders where the Morlocks got the meat.<PARAGRAPH>The Time Traveller reflects on how poorly equipped he is, since he only brought some matches. He only has a few matches left after entertaining the Eloi with them. <PARAGRAPH>The Morlocks come to examine him, but he's disgusted by them. The Time Traveller yells at them, but they keep coming. Then the Morlocks start grabbing at him.<PARAGRAPH>So the Time Traveller starts fending them off.  He manages to escape back up the well. He sees Weena and some other Eloi and passes out.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210628004820/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/time-machine-hg-wells/summary/chapter-6"}
