{"name": "chapter xxvii", "summary": "It is the Sunday of Julian West\u0092s first week in the new Boston. He feels \n        very depressed after hearing the sermon because he suddenly realizes how \n        different he is from the people of the twentieth century. He feels utterly \n        alone, and his feeling is made worse at the thought that the Leetes pity \n        him more than they like him. He goes to his underground chamber and sits \n        alone. Edith Leete shows up and tells him she has noticed he is feeling \n        sad. He has realized that he is in love with Edith, and he is sure that \n        she can never love him. He tells her that the sermon has made him realize \n        that her and her family\u0092s only emotion toward him is pity. She feels terrible \n        that she let him hear the sermon. She assures him that Mr. Barton does \n        not know him like she does and can therefore not know how good he is. \n        Inspired by her compassion for him, Julian West confesses to her that \n        he is in love with her. She blushes and then tells him she is also in \n        love with him. He embraces her and she pulls away, afraid that he will \n        think she has thrown herself on him when she has only known him for a \n        week.<PARAGRAPH>Inside the house, she whispers something to her mother and then goes \n        upstairs. Mrs. Leete tells Julian West that she is Edith Bartlett\u0092s grand-daughter, \n        and that she named her daughter, Edith, after this ancestor. After fourteen \n        years of mourning his death, Edith Bartlett had married. Edith Bartlett\u0092s \n        portrait and some letters she had kept from Julian West had been passed \n        down to Mrs. Leete. Edith Leete had always been taken with the story of \n        Julian West. She had often teased her parents that she would never marry \n        until she found a man like Julian West. When they found him in the underground \n        chamber, they also found a locket around his neck that held a picture \n        of Edith Bartlett, and they guessed his identity.<PARAGRAPH>Julian West goes up to see Edith in her room. He feels as if he has \n        regained the lost Edith Bartlett in her great-granddaughter: \u0093My love, \n        whom I had dreamed lost, had been re-embodied for my consolation.\u0094 He \n        adds that he has since always confused the two Ediths in his thinking. \n        Edith Leete also feels this \u0093confusion of identities\u0094 and tells him she \n        half-believes that Edith Bartlett\u0092s spirit has come back to finish what \n        was left undone when he disappeared. She actually has the idea that her \n        real name is Edith Bartlett.<PARAGRAPH>When Doctor Leete comes home, he congratulates Julian West on the news \n        and says he has suspected that it would happen from the moment he discovered \n        him. He thinks of his daughter as fulfilling her great-grandmother\u0092s pledge. \n        That evening, Julian West and Edith Leete stroll in the garden as they \n        revel in their new love. She wonders how women of the nineteenth century \n        were supposed to hide their emotions about love. When they part, she jokes \n        with him, asking him if he is jealous that Edith Bartlett married someone \n        else. Julian West confesses to his reader that he had felt such an irrational \n        emotion, but at Edith\u0092s joke, the bad feeling dissipated, and he assures \n        her that he is not at all jealous.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025235/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Looking_Backward_Bellamy/Looking_Backward_Study_Guide18.html"}
