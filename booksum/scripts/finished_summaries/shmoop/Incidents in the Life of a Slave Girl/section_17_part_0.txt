An old white friend of Aunt Martha's offers to take Linda in and hide her. Linda gets a message that she should leave her friend's house and go to a designated spot, where someone will be waiting to take her to her new home. This is all very Mission: Impossible, only a little lower-budget. Following these instructions, Linda sees her friend Betty at the meeting-spot. Betty takes her to the home of the white lady she works for and hides her in an old storage room. Dr. Flint tries a lot of different strategies to smoke her out. First, he throws William and Benny into jail. Then, he tells Aunt Martha that he knows where Linda is, thinking that Aunt Martha will give something away. She doesn't. Finally, Dr. Flint heads to New York to try to find her.", "analysis": ""}
