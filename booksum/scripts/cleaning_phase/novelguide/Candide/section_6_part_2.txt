{"name": "Chapter 12", "summary": "PARAGRAPH>Chapter 12<PARAGRAPH>The old woman continues her story, as she explains how the kind man cares for her. Soon, however, the man, who at one time worked as a court singer to the Princess of Palestrina-the woman's mother-shows he cannot be trusted. For instead of bringing her back to Italy as he promised, he instead sells her in Algiers. Through this ordeal, she comes down with the plague. Though she survives, she's sold and resold as a slave to countless merchants and traders. At one point her captors, facing starvation, even remove one of her buttocks for food. Finally she ends up as a servant to Don Issachar, the Jew who also buys Cunegonde at a later date. Finishing her story, she concludes with the thesis with which she began: she is the most miserable of human beings", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210213005525/https://www.novelguide.com/candide/summaries/chapter11-12"}
