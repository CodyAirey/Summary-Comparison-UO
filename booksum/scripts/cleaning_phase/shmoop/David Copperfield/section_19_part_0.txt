{"name": "Chapter 20", "summary": "The next morning, a chamber-maid knocks on David's door to tell him there's water for shaving outside his door.<PARAGRAPH>David blushes: he doesn't need to shave yet, and he's sure the chamber-maid knows it and is laughing at him.<PARAGRAPH>Steerforth is waiting for David in a private dining room.<PARAGRAPH>David feels rather shy in front of Steerforth, who is so much grander than David is.<PARAGRAPH>Steerforth asks David all about him.<PARAGRAPH>David is pleased that Steerforth is so interested. He tells Steerforth his plans to visit Yarmouth.<PARAGRAPH>Steerforth hears that David is not in a hurry and invites David to his mother's house in Highgate to stay for a few days.<PARAGRAPH>David is delighted to accept.<PARAGRAPH>He's so excited: he writes to his aunt to tell her of his change of plans, and then David and Steerforth see some of the sights of London.<PARAGRAPH>They go to a museum, and David is impressed with Steerforth's knowledge of everything.<PARAGRAPH>David comments that Steerforth will certainly get a graduate degree out of his higher education.<PARAGRAPH>Steerforth laughs yet again and says that he has no intention of pursuing further education.<PARAGRAPH><PARAGRAPH>Steerforth wonders why he should bother with fame or acclaim when he's satisfied with what he has?<PARAGRAPH>David is embarrassed at his misstep and changes the subject.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, they travel out to Mrs. Steerforth's house, where Steerforth's mother greets them.<PARAGRAPH>The house is old-fashioned, quiet, and neat.<PARAGRAPH>There is a second lady in the dining room: she is thin and sharp looking, about 30, with a scar on her mouth that slightly changes the shape of her upper lip. This is Miss Rosa Dartle.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Dartle has an odd way of speaking: she never comes out and says anything straight, but she hints quite broadly.<PARAGRAPH>For example, she hints that Steerforth is living a wild life at college and not learning anything.<PARAGRAPH>This happens a second time when David mentions that he plans to visit the Peggottys, whom Steerforth has met.<PARAGRAPH>David explains the Mr. Peggotty has adopted Ham and little Emily, so his house is full of people who Mr. Peggotty has been kind to.<PARAGRAPH>Steerforth comments that they seem worth his attention.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Dartle chimes in to ask if they really seem worth his notice, as though they were animals or beings of another order?<PARAGRAPH>Steerforth clarifies that he thinks there is a difference between them  and us  - they may be very good people, but they can't be expected to be as sensitive or fine as people with better breeding.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Dartle thanks him for making her feel better: she had been worried that poor people suffer, but now she knows that they don't really feel things the way better people do.<PARAGRAPH>David thinks that Steerforth can't mean what he says, and that he must have made his comments about poor people to draw Miss Dartle out.<PARAGRAPH>Once they are alone, Steerforth asks David what he thinks of Miss Dartle.<PARAGRAPH>David comments that she seems very clever, and Steerforth agrees: she is so sharp that she seems all edge to Steerforth.<PARAGRAPH>David remarks on Miss Dartle's scar.<PARAGRAPH>Steerforth admits that he gave it to her: when he was a little boy, she irritated him and he threw a hammer at her.<PARAGRAPH>David is sorry to have brought it up, since it must be painful for Steerforth.<PARAGRAPH>Steerforth continues: Miss Dartle is an orphan of a cousin of Steerforth's father's who Mrs. Steerforth brought to live with her as a companion once Mr. Steerforth died.<PARAGRAPH>David comments  that Miss Dartle must love Steerforth like a brother.<PARAGRAPH>Steerforth hems and haws a bit, and then changes the subject.<PARAGRAPH>The next day, David keeps glancing at Miss Dartle's scar. He notices that, when she gets angry, it flushes dark and stands out clearly on her face.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Steerforth shows David all of Steerforth's old letters to her, his baby pictures, and a lock of his hair.<PARAGRAPH>David tells Mrs. Steerforth that Steerforth practically saved his life at Mr. Creakle's school, and that he has always been generous and noble to David.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Steerforth agrees that Salem House was not good enough for her son, but Steerforth needed to go there because they had trouble finding a teacher who would \"be content to bow himself\"  before Steerforth's superior character.<PARAGRAPH>Steerforth's mother adds that her son had to go to a school where he could be the acknowledged king of the place.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Steerforth is delighted that David is so devoted to her son, but she also finds it only natural that her son should inspire such feelings in his fellow men.<PARAGRAPH>During this conversation, Miss Dartle is busy playing backgammon with Steerforth, but David is certain that she doesn't miss a word of any of this.<PARAGRAPH>Later on, Steerforth calls David Daisy again, and Miss Dartle jumps on it.<PARAGRAPH>She asks if it means that David is young and innocent.<PARAGRAPH>She comments that Steerforth thinks David is innocent, and so he is willing to be friends with him.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Dartle goes to bed soon after, and Steerforth and David stay up late and talk about old school times.<PARAGRAPH>When David goes to bed, he notices that there is a portrait of Miss Dartle on his wall.<PARAGRAPH>He finds it disturbing, and starts having uneasy dreams filled with doubts about the people around him.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200929182814/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/david-copperfield/summary/chapter-20"}
