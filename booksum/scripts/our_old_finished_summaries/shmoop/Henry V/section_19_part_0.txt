{"name": "Act 4, Scene 3", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210516192621/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/henry-v/summary/act-4-scene-3", "summary": "At the English camp, we learn that Henry's army is seriously outnumbered. Things are not looking good. Westmoreland says he wishes they had some more soldiers here with them. In response, Henry delivers a famous speech that begins \"If we are marked to die, we are enough / To do our country loss; and if we live, / The fewer men, the greater share of honour.\" Henry declares that he doesn't want to fight alongside any man who doesn't want to be there with him. He tells his soldiers they can leave if they want to and even offers to give them cab fare for the ride home. To those who chose to stay and fight alongside him, though, Henry says they'll become his \"band of brothers\" and everyone will remember that they fought with him on St. Crispin's Day. Psst. Watch Kenneth Branagh deliver the St. Crispin's Day speech here. As Henry and his army prepare to fight, Montjoy shows up with a message from the French Constable, who says he's giving Henry one last chance to give up. Henry, of course, refuses, and sends Montjoy back to the French camp.", "analysis": ""}
