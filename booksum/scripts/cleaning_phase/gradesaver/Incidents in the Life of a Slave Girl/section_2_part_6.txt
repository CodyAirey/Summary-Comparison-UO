{"name": "Chapter XVIII", "summary": "PARAGRAPH>Chapter XVIII - Months Of Peril<PARAGRAPH>Harriet marvels at how long and diligently the search for her went on. She sent messages to her relatives who told her they despaired that she would ever succeed at her escape. Nevertheless, Harriet's motto was \"Give me liberty, or give me death\". PARAGRAPH>Harriet moved to the house of a kind white woman who was friends with her grandmother. One of her slaves, Betty, led Harriet to a small room above the woman's own apartment and told her that was where she could hide. Harriet was overwhelmed with this woman's benevolence and care. PARAGRAPH>Harriet learned that Dr. Flint had put her brother William and her two children in jail. In a letter, William told her to remain steadfast and not come after them. Betty went to see them sometimes and reported back to Harriet. PARAGRAPH>One day Dr. Flint visited her grandmother and told her that he knew where Harriet was and that he was about to go get her. News traveled to Harriet in her hiding place. She was terrified, but they soon learned that the Dr. was lying. Some time later, Harriet heard his voice at Betty's house, but it turned out that he was so sure she was in New York he came to borrow money to go after her", "analysis": "In these chapters Harriet experiences the torturous and malevolent persecutions of Dr. Flint. Her master can barely keep a lid on his emotions as he rages over the birth of her first and then second child, and then her escape from the plantation. Harriet's escape, as with all slave escapes, represents a disruption in the traditional master-slave dynamic of the paternalistic southern society.  All of southern economics, politics, society, and culture revolved around slavery, and dissension or threats to the system were vigilantly ferreted out and eradicated . Harriet's Incidents is a remarkable work in that it shows how mad the system of slavery actually was. The scholar Geneva Cobb Moore writes that Jacobs's narrative \"enabled her to record for her generation and posterity the sexualization of slavery as a severe form of its neuroses\". Her Freudian reading of the text illuminates the pathological problem of this entire society.<PARAGRAPH>The focus of Incidents is Jacobs's sexed body as legally defined property. Dr. Flint often tells her he can do with her what he wants, and this is sadly true. Slave girls' bodies were not their own, and the children certainly were not either. Jacobs's body \"emerges as a trope for the ascribed identity of female slaves and the institutionalization of slavery's erotic and neurotic character.\" Slavery presents a war between the slave, who tries to assert ownership over their body, and the master, who claims that the slave's body belongs to them. Because he adheres to the view that he owns Jacobs's body, Dr. Flint pursues her aggressively and neurotically until his own death years later. Although Freud did not articulate his theories until several years after the publication of Incidents, Jacobs's narrative anticipates the theories of hysteria, neurotic disorders, and libidinal sexual drives.<PARAGRAPH>Dr. Flint has obsessive and aggressive thoughts as well as actions towards Harriet. He is arrogant and attached to the romantic notion of his absolute power that being part of the planter aristocracy instilled in him. His behavior is clearly disturbing: he cannot help himself blurting out certain vile things to her; he strikes her occasionally, pushes her down the stairs, and violently cuts her hair; and he engages in secrecy and slyness in writing her notes and trying to seduce her. Moore notes that Dr. Flint's \"aggressive neurotic actions increase as his sexual anxieties mount and his sexual ambitions are rivaled.\" Harriet was right in her assumption that her involvement with Mr. Sands would disturb her master, but she most likely did not anticipate this reaction.<PARAGRAPH>Moore posits that, for her part, Harriet actually demonstrates a disturbing but understandable narcissism in response to his attention. She is clearly proud of her family lineage as well as her physical beauty. Freud \"described a compensatory relationship between women's beauty and their developing self-preservative narcissism.\" Harriet's beauty is able to raise her up slightly from her low social status and provides her with some leverage. When Dr. Flint proposes to set her up in a little house of her own, she even feels flattered.<PARAGRAPH>Overall, Incidents reveals the deeply pathological underpinnings of southern slave society, and through Dr. Flint in particular exemplifies the neuroses that result. Harriet's claim that slavery was not only bad for the slaves but for the whites as well certainly rings true.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180408172810/http://www.gradesaver.com/incidents-in-the-life-of-a-slave-girl/study-guide/summary-chapters-xiii-xviii"}
