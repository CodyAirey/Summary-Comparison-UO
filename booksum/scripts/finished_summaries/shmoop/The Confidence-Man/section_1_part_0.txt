As the title of the chapter suggests, we're dealing with a plethora of ideas here, and no one seems to be of one mind. Opinions about the cream-suited man range from Poor thing to Who dis? to Keep away from him to He just wants attention, so don't give him any. Lucky for him, the sleeping stranger has zero idea that this less-than-favorable commentary is going on around him. The ship is huge--carrying a dizzying array of passengers that get on and off at various ports. Eventually, the massive crowd breaks apart, forming groups, then trios, pairs, and finally individuals. The individuals constitute a cosmopolitan mass of people from all walks of life, from all over the world. No joke: Melville spends about a page listing all the different types of people he can think of--different cultures, different types of employment, different religions. All these people gather in a busy tangle of moving parts.", "analysis": ""}
