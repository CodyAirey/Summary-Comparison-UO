{"name": "Chapter 27", "summary": "This chapter's epigraph is two passages from George Crabbe's poem \"The Hall of Justice.\" The first part of the quote is in the voice of a judge condemning the second speaker for his crimes. The second part of the quote is from the criminal, who wants to confess his terrible life.<PARAGRAPH>Urfried doesn't lead Cedric out of the castle, as she promised.<PARAGRAPH>Instead, she leads him to a room where they can talk.<PARAGRAPH>Urfried knows that Cedric is a Saxon, and she wants to tell him her life story.<PARAGRAPH>Urfried is the daughter of Torquil Wolfganger, Cedric's father's friend.<PARAGRAPH>Urfried realizes that the man in front of her is none other than Cedric of Rotherwood.<PARAGRAPH>Cedric is equally shocked to realize that Urfried is none other than Ulrica, whom the Saxons had all mourned as dead.<PARAGRAPH>She was taken prisoner by Reginald Front-de-Boeuf Senior, the current Front-de-Boeuf's father.<PARAGRAPH>Reginald Front-de-Boeuf Senior murdered Ulrica's father.<PARAGRAPH>Throughout her captivity, she has hated the Normans. She has done her best to encourage their rivalries and in-fighting.<PARAGRAPH>Her greatest achievement was in provoking Reginald Front-de-Boeuf Junior into killing his father.<PARAGRAPH>But with the death of her rapist , Ulrica lost all of her power in the Front-de-Boeuf household.<PARAGRAPH>She has been reduced to the status of a servant, and grown aged and vicious.<PARAGRAPH>Cedric thinks it would have been better if she had died rather than live this sinful life.<PARAGRAPH>Ulrica begs Cedric not to leave her behind.<PARAGRAPH>Otherwise she will tell Front-de-Boeuf who Cedric really is underneath his friar disguise.<PARAGRAPH>Cedric is so disgusted by her that he won't stand by her side. He tells Ulrica to repent for her evil life.<PARAGRAPH>Ulrica resolves to live from now on as a true daughter of Torquil Wolfganger.<PARAGRAPH>Reginald Front-de-Boeuf arrives and Ulrica disappears.<PARAGRAPH>Front-de-Boeuf asks if the prisoners have been given their last rites.<PARAGRAPH>Cedric says they have.<PARAGRAPH>Cedric explains that he can only speak Saxon because he is a friar of Saint Withold .<PARAGRAPH>Front-de-Boeuf instructs Cedric to tell the outlaws whatever he can think of to make them stay at Torquilstone for 24 hours.<PARAGRAPH>Then Front-de-Boeuf asks if Cedric can read.<PARAGRAPH>Cedric says he cannot.<PARAGRAPH>Front-de-Boeuf instructs Cedric to take a written message to the castle of Philip de Malvoisin.<PARAGRAPH>Front-de-Boeuf wants to use his \"friar\" to delay the outlaws and to bring Norman reinforcements to destroy them.<PARAGRAPH>Front-de-Boeuf believes that the \"friar\" will help, even if he is a Saxon, because the outlaws rob churchmen and ordinary folk alike.<PARAGRAPH>Front-de-Boeuf watches Cedric leave the castle.<PARAGRAPH>Front-de-Boeuf then goes to Cedric's cell. He quickly realizes that the \"Cedric\" in the cell is an impostor, Wamba the jester.<PARAGRAPH>Front-de-Boeuf finally gets that the \"friar\" to whom he was just talking was Cedric himself.<PARAGRAPH>De Bracy sees that Wamba is willing to die for his master and tells Front-de-Boeuf to have mercy.<PARAGRAPH>The Normans turn to Athelstane.<PARAGRAPH>Athelstane offers them a thousand marks for his freedom.<PARAGRAPH>They agree to let him go if he will pull back the Saxon outlaws from Torquilstone. Also, Athelstane's ransom does not include Rebecca and Isaac.<PARAGRAPH>Athelstane is fine with that; he doesn't want to help two Jewish people anyway.<PARAGRAPH>De Bracy wants to keep Rowena, and Front-de-Boeuf wants to keep Wamba so he can torture and kill him.<PARAGRAPH>Athelstane protests that Rowena is his fiance.<PARAGRAPH>A monk arrives at the door of the castle.<PARAGRAPH>This time, it's a real monk - Brother Ambrose, a servant of Prior Aymer.<PARAGRAPH>Athelstane challenges the best knight among them to a duel, to pay for illegally capturing him.<PARAGRAPH>Front-de-Boeuf will agree to a duel once Athelstane is free and the ransom paid.<PARAGRAPH>The Saxon prisoners are taken away.<PARAGRAPH>Brother Ambrose arrives bringing news that Prior Aymer has been kidnapped by the Saxons.<PARAGRAPH>Prior Aymer hopes the Norman knights will ransom him.<PARAGRAPH>Brother Ambrose also says that the Saxons outside are preparing to set siege on the castle.<PARAGRAPH>Front-de-Boeuf calls his men to arms.<PARAGRAPH>De Bracy recognizes the Black Knight among the castle's attackers.<PARAGRAPH>Front-de-Boeuf wants revenge against the Black Knight for his defeat during the tournament.<PARAGRAPH>The knights arrange themselves for battle.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210614173333/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/ivanhoe/summary/chapter-27"}
