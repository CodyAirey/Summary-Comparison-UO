{"name": "Chapter 11", "summary": "Chillingworth is ticked off. He starts plotting his revenge, but, if you ask us, he really shouldn't bother: Dimmesdale is torturing himself enough for the both of them.<PARAGRAPH>Dimmesdale can tell something is wrong with the guy, but he figures that his intuition isn't trustworthy because he himself is such a big sinner.<PARAGRAPH>His entire congregation venerates him, but he just cannot deal. Even when he tells them how vile he is, they don't believe him.<PARAGRAPH>More than once, he's gone up to the pulpit resolved to confess, but he keeps  chickening out. Basically, he sickens himself.<PARAGRAPH>Instead of confessing, Dimmesdale commits acts of penance like beating himself mercilessly all night in a secret room. It's a lot less fun than it sounds.<PARAGRAPH>But no matter how hard he beats himself, he can't purify the sin.<PARAGRAPH>Night after night, he has visions of Hester Prynne, pointing her forefinger at the letter on the bodice of her dress and then at his breast.<PARAGRAPH>Okay, apparently we know who the father of her baby is now.<PARAGRAPH>And then he has an idea. He gets up from his chair and leaves the house, going out into the night.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20211014221130/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/scarlet-letter/summary/chapter-11"}
