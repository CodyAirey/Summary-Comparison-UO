On the way they blab with Henry doing his share of the jawing. He blames the generals for how poorly the Union side is doing . Another soldier ask Henry if he thinks he, Henry, fought the whole battle single-handedly, yesterday. This makes Henry choke for a minute; he's nervous that the men know his secret .
