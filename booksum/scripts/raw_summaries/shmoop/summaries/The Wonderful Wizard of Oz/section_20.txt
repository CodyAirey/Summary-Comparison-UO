The Lion's like, I'll kill it. No biggie. But afterwards, I want to be king.<PARAGRAPH>The animals agree and the Lion goes off in search of the spider. Fortunately, when he finds the beast, it is asleep, and the Lion lops off its head. Ewwww.<PARAGRAPH>All the animals of the forest bow down to the Lion.
