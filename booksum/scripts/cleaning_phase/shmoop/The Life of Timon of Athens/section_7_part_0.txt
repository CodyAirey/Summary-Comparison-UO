{"name": "Act 3, Scene 4", "summary": "Back at Timon's house, the creditors' servants are getting a little annoyed. They don't know why Timon hasn't paid them yet, and they decide the prognosis isn't good.<PARAGRAPH>Titus, one of the servants, declares it's pretty sad that his master is currently wearing a jewel from Timon, yet his master still sent him to collect more moolah from Timon, anyway.<PARAGRAPH>Hortensius joins in the bagging-on-your-master game. He knows his master has spent Timon's money and is ungrateful for all his gifts.<PARAGRAPH>It's clear that even the servants of these men think their masters are being unfair to Timon.<PARAGRAPH>Just then, Flavius tries to skirt by the creditors' servants by walking past in a brilliant disguise--a big old cloak. The servants stop him and demand their money.<PARAGRAPH>Flavius tells them there is nothing left. He has no money left to add up, so he is leaving.<PARAGRAPH>The servants get rowdier. Eventually, Timon shows up in a red-hot rage.<PARAGRAPH>Timon can't believe no one will help him out. After all he's done for them? How could they?<PARAGRAPH>Since he has no money and evidently no friends left, Timon decides to throw a huge banquet.<PARAGRAPH>Wait, what?<PARAGRAPH>We're not really sure how he can host a dinner party, and neither is Flavius, who hastily tells his master they don't even have enough food for that.<PARAGRAPH>But Timon doesn't care. Send out the invites. Summon his cook. There'll be a dinner party whether people like it or not.<PARAGRAPH>We think Timon's hatched a plan of some kind, but it's not clear what it is.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210615055243/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/timon-of-athens/summary/act-3-scene-4"}
