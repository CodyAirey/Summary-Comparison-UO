Long John Silver says he's doomed.<PARAGRAPH>George Merry  points to the reverse side of the spot, where it says, \"Deposed\" . <PARAGRAPH>Long John Silver says he's still captain until he hears the crew's problems with him and has a chance to answer.<PARAGRAPH>George answers that: 1) Long John Silver has messed up the whole plan; 2) he let their enemies leave their fort just because they wanted to; 3) he prevented the pirates from attacking their enemies as they were leaving the fort; and 4) he let Jim Hawkins live.<PARAGRAPH>George says they'll all be hanged thanks to Long John Silver and his mistakes.<PARAGRAPH>Long John Silver replies that it's not him who messed up the plan.
