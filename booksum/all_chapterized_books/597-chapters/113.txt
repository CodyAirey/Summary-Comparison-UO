113. OF SNORRI THE PRIEST, AND HIS STOCK

There was a man named Snorri, who was surnamed the Priest.  He
dwelt at Helgafell before Gudruna Oswif's daughter bought the
land of him, and dwelt there till she died of old age; but Snorri
then went and dwelt at Hvamsfirth on Saelingdale's tongue.
Thorgrim was the name of Snorri's father, and he was a son of
Thorstein codcatcher (1).  Snorri was a great friend of Asgrim
Ellidagrim's son, and he looked for help there also.  Snorri was
the wisest and shrewdest of all these men in Iceland who had not
the gift of foresight.  He was good to his friends, but grim to
his foes.

At that time there was a great riding to the Thing out of all the
Quarters, and men had many suits set on foot.


ENDNOTES:

(1)  Thorstein Codcatcher was the son of Thorolf Mostrarskegg,
     the son of Ornolf Fish-driver, but Ari the Wise says he was
     the son of Thorgil Reydarside.  Thorolf Mostrarskegg had to
     wife Oska, the daughter of Thorstein the Red.  The mother of
     Thorgrim was named Thora, a daughter of Oleif the Shy, the
     son of Thorstein the Red, the son of Oleif the White, the
     son of Ingialld, the son of Helgi; but the mother of
     Ingialld was Thora, a daughter of Sigurd Snake-eye, son of
     Ragnar Hairybreeks; but the mother of Snorri the Priest was
     Thordisa, the daughter of Sur, and the sister of Gisli.
