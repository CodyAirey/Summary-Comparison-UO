{"name": "Chapter 26", "summary": "The new guy talks about Judge James Hall, a friend of his father, and his viewpoints on backwoodsmen and American Indians.<PARAGRAPH>According to Judge Hall, backwoodsmen are \"Indian-haters par excellence\" with a complicated history as to why.<PARAGRAPH>At one point, James Hall has a mock Q&A with a fictional backwoodsman and another fictional neutral party to assess why such hatred persists.<PARAGRAPH>Hall argues that there's a deep-seated distrust among these people. It begins when hatred is passed down through mothers' milk during nursing and is then solidified through community hatred. This is some dark stuff.<PARAGRAPH>Ultimately, Hall describes two kinds of backwoodsmen: 1) those who are committed to being loners and 2) those who visit towns and cities on occasion.<PARAGRAPH>Committed loners, Hall claims, often \"break\" and find a limited kind of friendship with American Indians.<PARAGRAPH>Non-committed loners get their fix of society, so they remain \"Indian-haters par excellence\" their whole lives.<PARAGRAPH>The new guy notes that since we only ever meet the non-committed kind of loners, they're our only example of what committed backwoodsmen might be like, thus our evidence is always flawed.<PARAGRAPH>Here the cosmopolitan interrupts him: Just a moment please; need to refill my drink.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20211017011430/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/confidence-man/summary/chapter-26"}
