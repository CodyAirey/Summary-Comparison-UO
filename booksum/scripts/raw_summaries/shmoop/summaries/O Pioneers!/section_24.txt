{"name": "Part 4, Chapter 6", "summary": "While half the village of Saint-Agnes is mourning the death of Am\u00e9d\u00e9e, the other half is busy preparing for the confirmation service of all the little boys and girls.<PARAGRAPH>On Sunday morning, the bishop arrives from Hanover, and Emil\nrides out with 40 other French boys to meet him.<PARAGRAPH>As they return with the bishop, they pass by the graveyard,\nwhere Am\u00e9d\u00e9e's grave is already being dug.<PARAGRAPH>Before mass, Emil waits outside to see if Marie will show\nup. She doesn't. Frank rides up alone.<PARAGRAPH>After taking his seat in Am\u00e9d\u00e9e's empty row, the children\nstart to come in for their confirmation. But Emil's mind quickly turns to\nMarie. He begins to wonder whether something is wrong with her, whether she's\nsick or has had a fight with Frank.<PARAGRAPH>As he listens to the music, though, he starts to feel\nreleased from his worry. He has an epiphany: he realizes that good is stronger\nthan evil, that the world is a good place. He envisions \"a kind of rapture,\"\nin which love is possible without sin (4.6.6).<PARAGRAPH>He decides that he can't really covet Frank's wife, because Marie\nnever was Frank's true wife. He doesn't have Marie; he never found that rapture\nwith her that's above and beyond sin. Plus, if he had ever found it with it,\nFrank definitely would have \"destroyed\" it.<PARAGRAPH>But, the narrator comments dryly, Emil doesn't realize that\nhe's not the only person who's ever had this thought, nor the only man who's\never had such an \"equivocal revelation\" while listening to some good music.\nIn other words: who're you kidding, Emil? You're just looking for a loophole in\nGod's law.<PARAGRAPH>The confirmation comes after the mass, and all the parents\nand family members gather around the newly confirmed kids. Everyone goes his or\nher separate way, and Emil hears a few songs performed for the bishop.<PARAGRAPH>During one of the songs, Emil slips away. He mounts his\nhorse, and \"at the height of excitement,\" in which death always seems\n\"very near,\" he rides off (4.6.9).<PARAGRAPH>He rides past Am\u00e9d\u00e9e's grave, and feels nothing; \"ecstasy\nhas no fear of death,\" the narrator comments.<PARAGRAPH>Just when he's passed the graveyard, Emil realizes where he's\ngoing: to say goodbye to Marie.<PARAGRAPH>As he rides, he seems to be flying. Everywhere around him is\nthe smell of wheat.<PARAGRAPH>Emil arrives at the Shabata house and ties his horse in the\nstable. He searches in the house for Marie but doesn't find her.<PARAGRAPH>He heads into the orchard. He passes between the cherry\ntrees and heads to the wheat fields.<PARAGRAPH>Emil sees her lying down under the white mulberry tree,\nasleep. It has been, the narrator tells us, the first day of her new life, in\nwhich she hopes to live forever with her dream of \"perfect love\" (4.6.11).<PARAGRAPH>Emil throws himself down beside her and takes her in his\narms.<PARAGRAPH>As she wakes up, she hides her face against him, telling him\nthat she has been dreaming about this, and not to take her dream away.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219131311/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/o-pioneers/summary/part-4-chapter-6"}
