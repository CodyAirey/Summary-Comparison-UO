Frank wants to read the Bible really badly, but he doesn't mean to rush the old man.<PARAGRAPH>Old man: It's not a thing. Here, knock yourself out.<PARAGRAPH>Frank reads. He starts to look like someone kicked his dog. The old man wants to know: Why so sad, panda bear?<PARAGRAPH>Frank tells the old man about the line from the Bible that the barber mentioned. He's upset that there are lines in the Bible that shake one's confidence in one's fellow man.<PARAGRAPH>The old man gets it. If you don't have confidence in your fellow man, then it's like not having confidence in the creator of man.<PARAGRAPH>Frank: Yes.

No dice.<PARAGRAPH>The old man gets up to go to bed, but he's looking for a life preserver. Frank says his seat is one.<PARAGRAPH>Grabbing his new lock, money belt, and life preserver, the old man gets ready to go.
