The others follow to watch the Cardinal laugh at Pescara's inability to follow instructions.<PARAGRAPH>After killing the Cardinal's servant, Bosola wounds the Cardinal, who doesn't seem to understand why Bosola would want to kill him.<PARAGRAPH>Bosola continues to stab the Cardinal when Ferdinand comes in.<PARAGRAPH>At this point, things just become kind of farcical--Ferdinand both a) has no idea what's going and b) is still totally cray, and so after babbling a bit he both wounds his own brother further and, totally by accident, deals a mortal wound to Bosola.<PARAGRAPH>Bosola kills Ferdinand, as the latter cries out about ambition and his sister and death. Geez, finally.<PARAGRAPH>The noblemen upstairs finally get into the room, and are pretty shocked at what they find.<PARAGRAPH>Bosola claims that he's completing his revenge for the Duchess, Antonio, Julia, and himself.<PARAGRAPH>The Cardinal dies.<PARAGRAPH>After painting a bleak picture of the world as a \"shadow, or deep pit of darkness\" , Bosola dies.<PARAGRAPH>Delio comes in with Antonio and the Duchess's son, only to find that he's way too late to the Blood and Guts Party to be of any use.<PARAGRAPH>He closes the play by telling the assorted noblemen that they have to try to make the best of the tragedy, and that they've got to establish the eldest son--now the only surviving member of the entire family--as the heir to his mother's position and her integrity.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20211022035429/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/the-duchess-of-malfi/summary/act-5-scene-5"}
