Canto XLVII. Sita.


Still on the ground where Rama slept
Their faithful watch the Vanars kept.
There Angad stood o'erwhelmed with grief
And many a lord and warrior chief;
And, ranged in densest mass around,
Their tree-armed legions held the ground.
Far ranged each Vanar's eager eye,
Now swept the land, now sought the sky,
All fearing, if a leaf was stirred,
A Rakshas in the sound they heard.
The lord of Lanka in his hall,
Rejoicing at his foeman's fall,
Commanded and the warders came
Who ever watched the Maithil dame.
"Go," cried the Rakshas king, "relate
To Janak's child her husband's fate.
Low on the earth her Rama lies,
And dark in death are Lakshman's eyes.
Bring forth my car and let her ride
To view the chieftains side by side.
The lord to whom her fancy turned
For whose dear sake my love she spurned,
Lies smitten, as he fiercely led
The battle, with his brother dead.
Lead forth the royal lady: go
Her husband's lifeless body show.
Then from all doubt and terror free
Her softening heart will turn to me."

  They heard his speech: the car was brought;
That shady grove the warders sought
Where, mourning Rama night and day,
The melancholy lady lay.
They placed her in the car and through
The yielding air they swiftly flew.
The lady looked upon the plain,
Looked on the heaps of Vanar slain,
Saw where, triumphant in the fight,
Thronged the fierce rovers of the night,
And Vanar chieftains, mournful-eyed,
Watched by the fallen brothers' side.
There stretched upon his gory bed
Each brother lay as lie the dead,
With shattered mail and splintered bow
Pierced by the arrows of the foe.
When on the pair her eyes she bent,
Burst from her lips a wild lament
Her eyes o'erflowed, she groaned and sighed
And thus in trembling accents cried:
