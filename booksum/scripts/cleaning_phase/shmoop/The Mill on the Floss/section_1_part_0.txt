{"name": "Book 1, Chapter 2", "summary": "Mr. Tulliver announces that he wants Tom to get a good education. He thinks Tom's current school is terrible and wants to send him to a better one so that he can become something cool one day, like an engineer or a surveyor.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Tulliver does not want Tom to be a lawyer though, because lawyers are evil. But Tom will need a good education to deal with lawyers. Apparently, in this period lawyers roamed the earth like zombies, causing problems and stealing people's money. Only the power of a good education could combat them.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Tulliver also notes that \"Old Harry\" created the lawyers. <PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Tulliver is down with this plan, but she thinks Mr. Tulliver should talk things over with her sisters, Mrs. Pullet and Mrs. Glegg.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Tulliver shoots that idea down.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Tulliver defends her family and reiterates that Tom can go somewhere to school as long as it's not too far away.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Tulliver continues to talk about Tom's education and Mrs. Tulliver starts talking about household matters - neither are really listening to the other.<PARAGRAPH>After a bit, Mr. Tulliver decides that he'll run his plans for Tom by Mr. Riley, who is an informed individual apparently.<PARAGRAPH>But there is a problem: Mr. Tulliver is worried that Tom is a bit dumb and won't succeed at school. He is sad that his daughter got all the brains.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Tulliver laments that her daughter is always getting into trouble and she'll probably fall in the river and drown one day. If this were a movie, music of doom would now start playing.<PARAGRAPH>While Mr. Tulliver defends his daughter, Mrs. Tulliver complains about her physical appearance  and her crazy antics.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Tulliver wishes that her niece, Lucy, was her kid instead - Lucy looks more like her than her own kid.<PARAGRAPH>Maggie comes running inside and is very messy. She complains loudly about having to sew and do chores. Mr. Tulliver finds this hilarious, and Mrs. Tulliver complains some more.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210619215702/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/mill-on-the-floss/summary/book-1-chapter-2"}
