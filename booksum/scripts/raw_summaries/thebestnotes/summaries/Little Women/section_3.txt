{"name": "chapter 4", "summary": "One of the girls\u0092 favorite books is Pilgrim\u0092s Progress, a story which \n        was introduced to them by their father. Through the years they have sometimes \n        used the house as a setting for Pilgrim\u0092s journey and have acted out the \n        story, beginning in the basement and ending in the upstairs. At the top \n        of second floor staircase, they would release their \"burdens\" \n        and let them go tumbling down the steps. Nor are the analogies to real \n        life and modern burdens lost on them. In this chapter the particular burden \n        that each girl has to bear is discussed.<PARAGRAPH>The morning after the New Year\u0092s Eve party begins with all the girls \n        feeling cross. Even Mrs. March seems a little frustrated as she rushes \n        to complete an important letter. Jo\u0092s urging of everyone to \"shoulder \n        their burdens\" and come home in better moods sets the scene for the \n        author to provide a little insight into the girls\u0092 motivations. Meg\u0092s \n        burden is that she remembers when the family was financially well off, \n        and she misses having pretty things and nice clothes. She works as a governess \n        for a number of children who, she feels, do not appreciate her or make \n        it worth bothering to look pretty. However, at the King\u0092s home, she daily \n        sees all the things that she is having to do without, and, we are told, \n        it sometimes makes her a little bitter.<PARAGRAPH>Jo\u0092s burden is the childless Aunt March with whom she spends her days. \n        The elderly woman had offered to adopt one of the girls when trouble came \n        to the family, and was for some time offended at being turned down. However, \n        Jo suited her, and was thus taken on as a companion. One of the attractions \n        to Aunt March\u0092s house is the large library that had belonged to Uncle \n        March. Aunt March, however, usually wants Jo to read books of historical \n        and political essays that the teenage girl finds impossibly dull.<PARAGRAPH>Beth\u0092s burden is one of such extreme shyness that she is unable to attend \n        school. She amuses herself with domestic chores, home-study and caring \n        for her collection of dolls. She seems to be very fragile and utterly \n        selfless, but she does cry in private over her longing for music lessons. \n        She plays the ancient tuneless instrument they have, but loves music and \n        hopes that some day she will have a fine piano.<PARAGRAPH>Amy\u0092s burden is primarily one of vanity, somewhat like Meg, but perhaps \n        a little more self-centered. She thinks her nose is too flat, and has \n        to wear her cousin\u0092s hand-me-down clothes which-to her artistic sensibilities-are \n        tasteless and in all the wrong colors for her.<PARAGRAPH>That evening each girl recounts her day, airing all of her complaints. \n        Jo accidentally gave herself an opportunity to read a more interesting \n        book to Aunt March when she laughed aloud over a funny section in \"Vicar \n        Wakefield.\" The Kings seemed to have been engaged in domestic quarreling \n        when Meg arrived. Amy bemoans a carnelian ring that a girl in school was \n        showing off. Beth\u0092s experience of the day is positive; she had gone to \n        the fish market for her Hannah and had seen a poor woman who was offering \n        to clean the store for food for her children. The store owner refused \n        her, but Mr. Laurence was also there and he purchased a slab of fish for \n        her.<PARAGRAPH>Marmee finishes off the chapter and the day by giving the girls a little \n        sermon about appreciating the blessings they have and by pointing out \n        the lessons in each girl\u0092s adventure.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025235/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Little_Women_Alcott/Little_Women_Study_Guide05.html"}
