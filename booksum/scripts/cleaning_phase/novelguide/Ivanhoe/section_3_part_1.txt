Then the Knight is informed that he may choose the Queen of Love and of Beauty who is to preside over the next day of the tournament. The Knight chooses Rowena. This disappoints Prince John, who had hinted that the Knight should choose Alicia, daughter of his counselor, Waldemar Fitzurse. But the Prince is gracious and invites Rowena to the banquet that night.
