One day, she runs into her daughter Ellen on the street. Linda sends a note to Mrs. Hobbs, the cousin of Mr. Sands who now keeps Ellen. Linda is allowed to visit, and she learns that Ellen has not been put in school yet, even though Mr. Sands insisted she be educated. Mrs. Hobbs tells Linda that Ellen will make a great waiting-maid for her daughter. She seems to have no intention of educating Ellen and really emphasizes that Mr. Sands \"gave\" her Ellen--as in, gave like a slave. Linda freaks out just a little and writes to Dr. Flint and to his daughter, to see if he will sell her. Unsurprisingly, he refuses.", "analysis": ""}
