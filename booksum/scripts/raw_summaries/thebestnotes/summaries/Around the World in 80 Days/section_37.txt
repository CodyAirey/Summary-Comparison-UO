{"name": "chapter 33", "summary": "After one day of being on the \u2018Henrietta\u2019, Fogg takes \nover as the Captain of the ship after having bribed the entire crew and after \nlocking Andrew Speedy in a cabin. Fogg wished to take the ship to Liverpool. Everything \nwent well for the first few days and then the ship got caught in a gale. The ship \nhas to fight the wind and they lose time as a result. Also since the ship had \nbeen traveling on full steam the vessel runs out of coal, as fuel. Fogg nevertheless \nasks the engineer to run the ship on full steam. He then summons Speedy and pays \nhim enough money to be allowed to burn parts of the ship, in order to use them \nas fuel. Speedy appreciates the large sum of money and lets Fogg do whatever he \nwants with the ship. The ship manages to reach Queenstown Harbor and Fogg plans \nto go to Liverpool from here. They reach Liverpool, and now have only six hours \nin which to reach England. At this moment, Fix arrests Fogg.<PARAGRAPH>Notes\nIn this chapter we learn why Fogg had agreed to board the ship to \nBordeaux. He did not plan to go there and he takes over the ship and proceeds \ntowards Liverpool instead. As we can all see, beneath the calm exterior is the \nfiery warmth of passion. Fogg bribes the entire crew and locks Andrew Speedy in \nhis cabin. Fogg is definitely a courageous man who knows how to achieve his goal. \nWhen it is required that he be civilized, he is but when he sees that Speedy is \ngoing to be difficult, he changes his tactics too.<PARAGRAPH>Fogg takes over the \nship and when he does, it is not that he does not know how to control it. We learn \nthat Fogg must have been a sailor once upon a time as he handles the ship with \ncourage and expertise.<PARAGRAPH>Throughout the chapter, Fogg is the dynamic force; \nhe is the creator of action while all others are spectators. Passepartout admires \nFogg\u2019s bold decision Aouda is worried for Fogg, while Fix does not know what to \nthink, as he is so astounded.<PARAGRAPH>Fogg guides the ship through a hurricane and when they run out of fuel the ship\u2019s \nwood is used to provide power. Fogg\u2019s dynamism and \u2018never say die\u2019 attitude sees \nhim through every situation. Andrew Speedy pays him a compliment, when he says \nthat Fogg has some of the Yankee in him. That would mean that Fogg is strong, \nbrave and adventurous and has the unflagging spirit.<PARAGRAPH>They manage to reach \nQueenstown Harbor with a lot of difficulty and after Fogg gives a lot of money \nto Speedy. Now they have only a few hours left and they move rapidly towards London. \nBut, when they are in Liverpool, Fix finally does what he had been planning to \ndo since such a long time. He arrests Fogg.<PARAGRAPH>We see in this chapter that \nthings do not move too smoothly for Fogg. But he faces the obstacles with spirit \nand manages to reach quite close to England. The arrest of course is the most \ndifficult hurdle to cross. We wonder why Passepartout had not informed Fogg about \nFix. It would have saved the hero of the story a lot of trouble.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141554/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Around_The_World_In_80_Days/Around_The_World_In_Eighty_Days31.html"}
