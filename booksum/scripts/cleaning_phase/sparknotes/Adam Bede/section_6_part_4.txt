{"name": "book 4, Chapter 30", "summary": "Chapter 30 Hetty worries about whether Adam will tell the Poysers about her affair with Captain Donnithorne. She is relieved when he says that he wants to see her alone. Adam tells her that Captain Donnithorne has told him that he never cared for her, but she does not believe him. He gives her the letter from Captain Donnithorne, and Hetty does not read it immediately but convinces herself that it must say something different from what Adam says. On his way home, Adam encounters Seth and apologizes for being gruff with him. Seth gives Adam a letter from Dinah in which Dinah ruminates on the importance of having sorrow in our lives so that we can feel what the rest of the world is feeling. Adam tells Seth that he hopes Dinah will come to love him and encourages Seth to go see her in Snowfield", "analysis": "Chapter 27-31 Hetty's decision to marry Adam, as strange as it may seem, coming on the heels of her disappointment about Captain Donnithorne, reflects the true nature of Hetty's feelings toward Captain Donnithorne and Hetty's incapacity to love. To Hetty, love and marriage are merely means to an end, and that end is being physically comfort. Hetty's only concern, even in her love affairs, is a selfish desire to be happy and taken care of. Hetty's decision to marry Adam is a central fact of the book because it requires the reader to see Hetty for what she is rather than considering her to be a naive, young girl who was victimized by an older man in a position of power. Although it is true that Hetty is young and simple and that she was seduced, her inherently selfish nature shines through at this moment. She is at her least sympathetic when deciding that because she cannot become a lady's maid, she might as well marry a decent, hard-working man. This decision magnifies the hardness of heart Hetty demonstrated when she rejected Dinah's attempts to love her and give her advice, and it prepares the reader for Hetty's actions later in the novel. It also demonstrates the fact that Hetty simply cannot love but can only act in her own self-interest.<PARAGRAPH>Adam's momentary belief that he has killed Captain Donnithorne marks a turning point for Adam, in which he begins to see that evil, especially evil that cannot be undone, is useless no matter what prompted it. After this moment, Adam will not be able to act on his passions again, even when extreme hardship comes his way. The Adam Bede the reader knows in the first part of the novel, up until the fight with Captain Donnithorne, is a good man who is basically untested. He has faced hardship, but he has not faced a true crisis of conscience. Even the death of his father caused in Adam only a momentary reflection that he should be less proud. For the most part, Adam acts on his instincts. His instincts are toward the good, and so his life up until this point has been marked by helping others and doing good work. But Adam has never been forced to examine his own actions and his own motivations. He knows that he is a proud man, but he has never had to face the consequences of that pride. When he knocks down Captain Donnithorne and believes briefly that he has killed him, all that changes. He sees that his pride does not bring anything positive. From the moment Adam renders the captain unconscious, the reader is able to reflect on how Adam's pride has overcome him and question whether he will confront his own motivations and the motivations of others in the upcoming scenes of the story. Captain Donnithorne's decision to write the letter to Hetty, and especially the decision to include a warning to Adam, shows how deep his cowardice runs and how far he will go to preserve his image as a good man. Captain Donnithorne writes a letter to Hetty that he knows to be largely false just to preserve Adam's image of him, even though the letter will break Hetty's heart. Moreover, his self-delusion is so deep that he convinces himself that Adam has forced him to write the letter by confronting him and that it is somehow Adam's fault that Hetty's heart will be broken. The note to Adam on the letter, warning him that it may be better not to give the letter to Hetty at all, especially demonstrates how eager and willing he is to pass the buck from himself to anyone at all. He wants to believe that he is a good man, and he will go to great lengths to avoid facing the consequences of his own dishonorable actions. This characteristic is what causes him to be offended when Adam beats him at a fight he started and over an issue for which he certainly deserves a beating. After the fight, the captain retreats to his sense of superiority over Adam rather than own up to the depths of his transgressions with Hetty. Captain Donnithorne becomes a weak man in a position of power after the fight scene, and this weakness carries consequences throughout the remainder of the novel.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210124224836/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/adambede/section7/"}
