Both of them need forgiveness from each other, but perhaps one more so than the other.<PARAGRAPH>When Cordelia kneels before him, he tries to kneel to her. \"If you have poison for me, I will drink it,\" he tells her. \"I know you do not love me, for your sisters / have, as I remember, done me wrong. / You have some cause, they have not.\" \"No cause, no cause,\" Cordelia reassures him.<PARAGRAPH>They exit to continue this touching reunion scene offstage.<PARAGRAPH>Kent and the Gentleman stay behind to share intel.
