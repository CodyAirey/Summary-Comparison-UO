{"name": "Book 2, Chapter 8", "summary": "Time for a flashback!<PARAGRAPH>Clym is out visiting a friend and Thomasin comes in to tell her aunt that the wedding with Damon is back on.<PARAGRAPH>Her aunt is cautiously optimistic about the whole thing.<PARAGRAPH>Clym wrote a letter asking what's going on with Thomasin - he's shocked by the whole thing and wonders how Thomasin could \"mortify\" them so badly by getting jilted .<PARAGRAPH>Thomasin and her aunt discuss the situation. Thomasin knows that Damon is a jerk but feels she should make the best of it. Marriage would solve the scandal problem, at least.<PARAGRAPH>Diggory arrives in the flashback and we get the scene from Thomasin and Mrs. Yeobright's perspective this time.<PARAGRAPH>Then we jump forward in time to the wedding day.<PARAGRAPH>Thomasin is getting dressed and she elaborately braids her hair for the occasion, like she's Princess Leia or something.<PARAGRAPH>Thomasin goes to leave but then rushes back to hug her aunt. The two cry and part sadly.<PARAGRAPH>Clym returns home and asks what the deal is with Thomasin.<PARAGRAPH>His mom tells him the whole story and Clym is upset that no one filled him in earlier.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Yeobright tells him he doesn't know how hard it's been for Thomasin and to stuff it.<PARAGRAPH>Clym decides to attend the wedding, but Mrs. Yeobright tells him it's probably over by now.<PARAGRAPH>Diggory Venn shows up again and informs them that he spied on the wedding and everything went off without a hitch this time.<PARAGRAPH>But then Diggory informs everyone that Eustacia Vye was in attendance and stood up with Thomasin.<PARAGRAPH>The Yeobrights think it's bizarre.<PARAGRAPH>The narrator busts in and tells us that Eustacia came to stick it to Damon and the two had a rather tense confrontation at the wedding.<PARAGRAPH>Damon tries to gloat, but Eustacia knocks him down a few pegs by saying \"You mistake; it gives me sincerest pleasure to see her your wife today\" .<PARAGRAPH>So, there's an odd scene in which Mrs. Yeobright throws her shoe at Thomasin as she walks away. What's the deal here? Was she really that mad about the wedding? Well, actually, tossing a shoe at a bride was a good-luck custom at the time.
