{"name": "Chapter Forty-One: The Siege of La Rochelle", "summary": "The narrator of The Three Musketeers also provides a historical overview in this chapter.<PARAGRAPH>Remember the Huguenots and the Catholics from Mousqueton\u2019s story earlier? To recap, the Huguenots are French Protestants who saw Catholicism as far too invested in pompous ritual and overly materialistic. Since most of France, including all the powerful people, such as the King, were Catholic, the Huguenots were not in a good position. Several holy wars ensued, which were halted temporarily when King Henry IV of France issued the Edict of Nantes, (a proclamation that granted the Huguenots religious and political freedom within their own areas.)<PARAGRAPH>One of those areas was La Rochelle.<PARAGRAPH>La Rochelle became a hotbed of civic unrest, and foreign influence. The city revolted, and the Musketeers are on their way to put down this revolt.<PARAGRAPH>Although it\u2019s not historically accurate, the narrator frames the issue entirely around Queen Anne.<PARAGRAPH>The English are a natural ally of the Huguenots, (they are also Protestant and have the added benefit of not liking France).<PARAGRAPH>Still, in the world of The Three Musketeers, the Duke of Buckingham uses the war as a pretext for seeing Anne. The Cardinal uses the war as a pretext to get some revenge on the guy whom Anne currently favors. The narrator points out that the \"real stake in the game\u2026 was simply a kind look from Anne of Austria.\"<PARAGRAPH>Since he is not a Musketeer, D\u2019Artagnan is member of a company apart from his friends. The narrator says this might have troubled him had he known the dangers he was about to face.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan is going for a walk to reflect on life when he spots two muskets being aimed at him. He drops to the ground. Bullets fire at him. He runs back to camp as fast as possible while bullets continue coming at him. One of them hits his hat.<PARAGRAPH>He keeps running.<PARAGRAPH>Later, he considers who these enemies could be: the Rochellais, the Cardinal, or Milady.<PARAGRAPH>He decides it must be Milady.<PARAGRAPH>The next day, Dessessart signals out D\u2019Artagnan for a dangerous mission. He asks him to pick a couple men to go with him. The assignment is to evaluate the protection of a recently recaptured bastion.<PARAGRAPH>Four men volunteer to accompany D\u2019Artagnan.<PARAGRAPH>Before they reach the bastion, two of the men disappear.<PARAGRAPH>The rest of them go to check out the bastion and then commence a retreat. One of the men gets hit by a musket ball.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan is trying to help the wounded man when more shots ring out. He soon realizes that these shots are not coming from the enemy.<PARAGRAPH>Quickly, he falls to the ground and pretends to be hurt.<PARAGRAPH>The two would-be assassins\u2014the same soldiers who disappeared earlier\u2014come forward to make sure D\u2019Artagnan is really dead.<PARAGRAPH>He\u2019s not at all dead\u2014he gets up with his sword in hand!<PARAGRAPH>One of the men runs away straight into enemy fire. He falls.<PARAGRAPH>The other man begs for mercy, and tells D\u2019Artagnan that a woman named Milady put them up to this task. The man tells D\u2019Artagnan that the instructions are with his comrade. D\u2019Artagnan tells him to fetch it, but the man is too afraid to venture into enemy fire. D\u2019Artagnan winds up going himself. He finds a letter chastising the two would-be assassins for their neglect of keeping an eye on one particular woman; Milady hopes her assassins will do better getting rid of D\u2019Artagnan.<PARAGRAPH>He keeps the letter as future evidence.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan now fully comprehends what Milady will do to exact revenge on him. At the same time, he realizes that the Queen must have discovered where Milady was hiding Constance, and extricated the poor Madame Bonacieux.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan spares the life of the wounded man; the two of them go back to camp.<PARAGRAPH>Strangely enough, D\u2019Artagnan feels much more at ease regarding his life. The narrator points out that this means he still underestimates Milady.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210624190147/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/three-musketeers/summary/chapter-forty-one-the-siege-of-la-rochelle"}
