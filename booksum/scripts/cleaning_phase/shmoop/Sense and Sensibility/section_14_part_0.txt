They can't understand what's going on with Willoughby.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Dashwood thinks that Mrs. Smith is sending Willoughby away intentionally, to separate him from Marianne. Elinor, however, is sure that there's something up - and that Willoughby's not being honest with them.<PARAGRAPH>Again, the pair wonders if Willoughby and Marianne are really engaged.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Dashwood remains firmly convinced that Willoughby's a good guy.<PARAGRAPH>That evening, Marianne looks like she's been crying, and is about to cry some more.
