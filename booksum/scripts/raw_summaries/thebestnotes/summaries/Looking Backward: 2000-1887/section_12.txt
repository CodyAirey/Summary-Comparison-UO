{"name": "chapter xii", "summary": "Julian West\u0092s next questions center around the notion of incentives \n        to work. As usual, after the women leave, he and Doctor Leete continue \n        their conversation. The doctor describes the organization of men at work \n        as an army with several grades of rank achieved by merit. The most superior \n        men are the captains of the force, and they keep the men under their charge \n        from lagging. The first grade is that of common workers. It is like a \n        school where young men are taught \u0093habits of obedience, subordination, \n        and devotion to duty.\u0094 Records are kept on each man. Each industry is \n        divided into first, second and third grades, and often these grades are \n        subdivided into first and second classes. The advantage of achieving a \n        high grade is the privilege of election; that is, each man gets to join \n        the trade of his first choice. The lowest grade men often must go with \n        their second or third choice of a trade. Those who receive promotion receive \n        the nation\u0092s thanks, and their names are printed in the newspaper. They \n        get a badge of their new rank. These badges are graded also: grade one \n        is gilt, grade two is silver, and grade three is iron.<PARAGRAPH>Aside from the incentive of the high ranks, these men also enjoy special \n        privileges and immunities from discipline. It is also regarded as very \n        important that the majority of men, even those of lesser abilities, aspire \n        to rise in rank. Many ways of recognizing merit are therefore devised. \n        In the case of a person who is able to work and refuses, he is sentenced \n        to solitary confinement on bread and water until he changes his mind.<PARAGRAPH>Doctor Leete asks Julian West if he now understands that incentive is \n        provided in this new system without the idea of varying wages. Julian \n        West thinks the incentives are too strong. He tells his readers, in fact, \n        that he still thinks so after having learned many things about this system. \n        Doctor Leete explains that there is so much leisure in the life of a worker, \n        that the pace is never too much for him. He also reminds Julian West about \n        the fundamental precept that \u0093all who do their best are equally deserving, \n        whether the best be great or small.\u0094<PARAGRAPH>Doctor Leete then explains that there is a separate corps for those \n        who are infirm, called the invalid corps. All those who are physically, \n        mentally, or emotionally handicapped are assigned to duties that fit their \n        abilities. When Julian West calls this admirable charity, since they are \n        incapable of self-support, Doctor Leete objects to the term. He asserts \n        that no one in an advanced civilization is capable of self-support. The \n        whole system operates on \u0093a complex mutual dependence\u0094 within which the \n        tasks are specialized. He adds that the fact that the nineteenth century \n        did not recognize this constituted its \u0093essential cruelty and unreason.\u0094 \n        Julian West continues to object on the basis that such people (the invalid \n        corps) do not produce anything. Doctor Leete reiterates the point that \n        all people have a right to be maintained by virtue of their humanity, \n        not according to their abilities. Julian West is astounded that the handicapped \n        receive the same income as the others. Doctor Leete draws the analogy \n        of taking care of a sick brother. Instead of feeding and clothing him \n        with lesser care, people would be more likely to give him even better \n        care than the norm. Julian West again objects, saying that the analogy \n        is not sound because a brother is not the same as a fellow citizen. Doctor \n        Leete tells him that it is in this kind of thinking that Julian West shows \n        himself to be of the nineteenth century. He adds that the solidarity of \n        the race is the same as physical kinship in this twentieth-century society. \n        For Doctor Leete, if a solution leaves a group of people unaccounted for, \n        it is not really a solution.<PARAGRAPH>Doctor Leete explains his logic in another way. He says that the advances \n        that led to the industrial revolution were a long time in the making. \n        They had been produced by previous generations and were therefore like \n        an inheritance for the nineteenth century. When the able-bodied took this \n        inheritance and kept it to themselves, leaving nothing for the sickly, \n        they were stealing the birthright of their fellow citizens. Julian West \n        is unable to reply to this idea. Doctor Leete sighs, saying he can never \n        understand what motivated the workers of the nineteenth century to work, \n        since it was so clear that their children could easily be cast outside \n        and starved.<PARAGRAPH>Julian West adds a note to this chapter on the idea of giving everyone \n        an opportunity to choose the field that best suits his abilities and inclinations. \n        He notes that this was one of the great wastes of his own age. Most people \n        of the nineteenth century were forced by circumstances to enter a trade \n        and were never given a choice in the matter. Even the wealthy were kept \n        from finding work that suited their natural aptitude, because class prejudice \n        ruled out certain crafts and labor. With the habit of forcing people to \n        do things they did not like based on the incentive of money alone, most \n        people chose a trade that did not suit their abilities and were therefore \n        not very productive.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025235/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Looking_Backward_Bellamy/Looking_Backward_Study_Guide11.html"}
