{"name": "Book 2, Chapter 18", "summary": "Merdle has a farewell dinner for Dorrit, after which he walks him out to his carriage. This is high honor.<PARAGRAPH>Dorrit says good-bye to Fanny, praises her awesomeness, and wishes that Amy were more like her sister.<PARAGRAPH>As Dorrit goes back to his hotel, he sees Young John Chivery waiting for him. (Remember him? The kid from the prison who was in love with Little Dorrit.)

Without any kind of ulterior motives or anything \u2013 as he says, \"in my poor way, I am too proud to\" have any kind of secret meaning (2.18.30).<PARAGRAPH>Now Dorrit feels terrible and apologizes, but John looks traumatized.<PARAGRAPH>Dorrit asks about the Chiverys and also about the prisoners.
