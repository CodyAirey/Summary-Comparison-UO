{"name": "Chapter 16", "summary": "Scott opens this chapter with the first six lines of Thomas Parnell's poem \"The Hermit.\" A hermit is a religious man who decides to leave the world behind and live alone, praying and meditating about God.<PARAGRAPH>The narrator reminds the reader about the Black Knight who had disappeared so suddenly at the end of the tournament.<PARAGRAPH>We rejoin the knight as he is trying to go north.<PARAGRAPH>He gets lost in the curving roads of Yorkshire and decides to let his horse choose the way.<PARAGRAPH>The horse finds a tiny path that leads to a small chapel. Inside is a hermit.<PARAGRAPH>The Black Knight asks for either shelter for the night or directions to the main road.<PARAGRAPH>The hermit is really, really reluctant to help. He just wants to be left alone with his prayers.<PARAGRAPH>But he finally allows the Black Knight to come inside and have dinner.<PARAGRAPH>The hermit, whose title is the Clerk of Copmanhurst, settles in to some porridge after saying a long grace.<PARAGRAPH>In this chapter, the hermit is called Friar, but for the rest of the book, he is \"the Friar,\" so we're just going to call him that. (By the way, a friar is a monk who frequently ministers to the faithful.)<PARAGRAPH>When he pulls back his hood, the Black Knight sees that the hermit is youngish, healthy, and very strong looking.<PARAGRAPH>The Black Knight can't believe the Friar could stay so healthy looking on just a diet of porridge.<PARAGRAPH>The Friar admits that his sponsor leaves richer food, but he never eats it since he has taken a vow of self-denial.<PARAGRAPH>The Friar ducks back into his house and brings out a fine piece of deer meat baked into a pastry.<PARAGRAPH>It turns out that he hasn't really been denying himself, but he holds back from eating for a bit, since he doesn't want it to be too obvious.<PARAGRAPH>But the Black Knight insists, and finally the two men devour their rich meal.<PARAGRAPH>The Black Knight also guesses that the Friar has some wine hidden, which the two men split.<PARAGRAPH>They are getting quite drunk by now.<PARAGRAPH>The Black Knight hints that the Friar has been poaching \u2013 that is, killing animals that belong to someone else.<PARAGRAPH>For doubting the strength of his holy vows, the Friar challenges the Black Knight to a fight.<PARAGRAPH>It turns out that the Friar has some very fine weapons hidden away in his chapel.<PARAGRAPH>The Black Knight backs down at the sight of the Friar's swords and arrows.<PARAGRAPH>The two of them continue to drink happily together.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210614173333/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/ivanhoe/summary/chapter-16"}
