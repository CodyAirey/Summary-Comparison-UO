{"name": "chapter 7", "summary": "The Bennets have modest means. Mr. Bennet has only an income of two thousand a year, which unfortunately will \npass to a distant cousin on his death. Mrs. Bennet has inherited only four thousand pounds from her father, which does \nnot offer substantial security to her daughters.<PARAGRAPH>The young Bennet girls, especially Catherine and Lydia, frequently visit Meryton. It is a village in the vicinity of \nLongbourn where their maternal aunt, Mrs. Philips, resides. The arrival of a military regiment in the neighborhood is a \nsource of great excitement for the young girls. Mrs. Philips\u0092 accounts of the officers entertain Catherine and Lydia, and \nthey talk endlessly about the soldiers. Their father is bothered by their perpetual talk of men and calls them the silliest \ngirls in the country. Mrs. Bennet always defends them.<PARAGRAPH>A note arrives for Jane from Caroline Bingley, asking her to dinner since her brother and Darcy are dining out. Jane \nleaves for Netherfield on horseback, and heavy rains prevent her from returning home. A letter arrives at the Bennets \nthe next morning, stating that Jane is unwell, and, therefore, detained at Netherfield. Mrs. Bennet is thrilled rather than \nbeing upset on hearing this news. She views it as a favorable development of the matrimonial dream that she has for \nJane. Elizabeth is genuinely worried about her sister and walks three miles to Netherfield to check on her. By the time \nshe reaches the Bingley residence, Elizabeth is a mess. The ladies are appalled to see her dirty appearance. Darcy \nwonders why she has walked such a long distance in bad weather and all alone. At the same time he admires her \nbrilliant complexion, which is aglow with the warmth of exercise.<PARAGRAPH>When Elizabeth is taken to Jane, she finds her feverish. She has caught a \n        violent cold and needs bed-rest. Elizabeth is grateful when she is invited \n        to stay with her sister. A servant is dispatched to Longbourn to inform \n        her parents and to bring clothes for Jane and Elizabeth.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025227/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Pride_And_Prejudice_Austen/Pride_And_Prejudice_Study_Guide09.html"}
