{"name": "chapters 7 - 9", "summary": "These chapters are largely descriptive and do little to advance the \n        plot of the story. The busy arena where the knights will display their \n        skill is brilliantly described. The challengers, Bois-Guilbert, Front-de-Boeuf, \n        Grantmesnil, Malvoisin, and Ralph de Vipoint, are introduced and described \n        as seasoned Norman knights. Isaacs daughter Rebecca is also introduced.<PARAGRAPH>A stranger, beautifully attired in steel and gold armor, arrives at \n        the arena, challenges Bois-Guilbert, and emerges victorious; Bois-Guilbert \n        feels disgraced. The mysterious knight also wins on the second day of \n        the tournament and crowns Rowena as the Queen of Love and Beauty.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025232/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Ivanhoe_Sir_Walter_Scott/Ivanhoe_Study_Guide09.html"}
