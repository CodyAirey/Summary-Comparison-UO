{"name": "Chapter 1", "summary": "Meet Jim, a young guy who works as a \"water-clerk\" at various ports in Southeast Asia. That means that he helps ships get situated with fresh drinking water and other supplies before they head out to sea.<PARAGRAPH>Jim is good-looking and fairly popular, but people don't seem to know much about him. Good thing our narrator is in the know, and can give us the details.<PARAGRAPH>Flashback alert: Jim grew up in a parsonage  in England. Because he was a younger brother, he had no shot at inheriting his family's land, so he opted to become a sailor. Maybe he saw this gem and couldn't resist joining up.<PARAGRAPH>The early part of Jim's career goes pretty well, except for one night when he misses an opportunity to help rescue some people at sea.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210118112654/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/lord-jim/summary/chapter-1"}
