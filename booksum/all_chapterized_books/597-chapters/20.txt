20. OF NJAL AND HIS CHILDREN

There was a man whose name was Njal.  He was the son of Thorgeir
Gelling, the son of Thorolf.  Njal's mother's name was Asgerda
(1).  Njal dwelt at Bergthorsknoll in the land-isles; he had
another homestead on Thorolfsfell.  Njal was wealthy in goods,
and handsome of face; no beard grew on his chin.  He was so great
a lawyer, that his match was not to be found.  Wise too he was,
and foreknowing and foresighted (2).  Of good counsel, and ready
to give it, and all that he advised men was sure to be the best
for them to do.  Gentle and generous, he unravelled every man's
knotty points who came to see him about them.  Bergthora was his
wife's name; she was Skarphedinn's daughter, a very high-
spirited, brave-hearted woman, but somewhat hard-tempered.  They
had six children, three daughters and three sons, and they all
come afterwards into this story.


ENDNOTES:

(1)  She was the daughter of Lord Ar the Silent.  She had come
     out hither to Iceland from Norway, and taken land to the
     west of Markfleet, between Auldastone and Selialandsmull.
     Her son was Holt-Thorir, the father of Thorleif Crow, from
     whom the Wood-dwellers are sprung, and of Thorgrim the Tall,
     and Skorargeir.
(2)  This means that Njal was one of those gifted beings who,
     according to the firm belief of that age, had a more than
     human insight into things about to happen.  It answers very
     nearly to the Scottish "second sight."
