{"name": "Chapter 29", "summary": "The chapter opens in the breakfast room of the house where Oliver ended up. The two ladies are sitting and eating their breakfast, and are described for the first time: the older lady is very upright and elegant, and the young lady is around sixteen or seventeen, and very lovely.<PARAGRAPH>They ask Giles how long Brittles has been gone, and Giles answers that he\u2019d been gone for an hour or more.<PARAGRAPH>They joke about how Brittles \"always was a slow boy\" (29.10)\u2014it\u2019s a joke because Brittles started out working there when he was a boy. Now he\u2019s over 30, and they still call him a boy.<PARAGRAPH>Finally a coach pulls up, and a plump, friendly gentleman hops out and starts asking Mrs. Maylie and Rose how they\u2019re doing, after the fright of the night before.<PARAGRAPH>Rose says that they\u2019re fine, but that he should go and look after the \"poor creature up stairs\" (29.19).<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Losberne (who\u2019s the local doctor) heads on upstairs. We don\u2019t get to see what goes on up there, but only see Mrs. Maylie and Rose downstairs, waiting for a long time, and looking anxious.<PARAGRAPH>Finally the doctor comes back and asks if they\u2019d seen the thief.<PARAGRAPH>They say no, and Giles (realizing that the doctor\u2019s about to tell them that it\u2019s only a boy, and that he probably should have mentioned that earlier), says that he was going to tell them all about it, but that Mr. Losberne had arrived just then and interrupted.<PARAGRAPH>The doctor says that it is necessary that they see the thief.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419220659/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/oliver-twist/summary/chapter-29"}
