{"name": "Act III, Scene xi", "summary": "Antony, back at Cleopatra\u2019s palace in Alexandria, cries out in shame.<PARAGRAPH>He laments that he\u2019s lost to the world forever, and insists that his friends go to a ship he has left full of gold, divide up the spoils, and follow his example by fleeing.<PARAGRAPH>He says his lesser parts have defeated his nobler intuitions, and he has lost command (of himself and his men). Overall, he\u2019s kind of a wreck.<PARAGRAPH>Cleopatra enters.<PARAGRAPH>Antony is busy recounting what a noble soldier he used to be, like that time he oversaw the death of Brutus and Cassius. These victories are mitigated by his present shame.<PARAGRAPH>Cleopatra goes to comfort him, with her head hung and looking the very picture of shame.<PARAGRAPH>He asks her how she could lead him to this, and she is full of apologies\u2014she ran away because she was frightened, and never thought he would follow her.<PARAGRAPH>He responds in despair. His heart was tied to her rudder; he had to follow because his love for her rules his spirit.<PARAGRAPH>She\u2019s really sorry, it seems, but Antony now has to worry about seeking pardon from Caesar, which is sad since not too long ago he ruled half the world.<PARAGRAPH>Still, Cleopatra has power over him; he asks her for a kiss, as this will repay him for all the wrongs.<PARAGRAPH>He calls for wine and is determined to make merry. Antony chooses to deliberately ignore all the signs that the entire endeavor against Caesar is cursed.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210116191009/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/antony-cleopatra/summary/act-iii-scene-xi"}
