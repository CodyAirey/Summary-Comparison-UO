{"name": "chapter 35", "summary": "Fogg, Aouda and Passepartout return to the Savile \nRow house. Fogg seems calm outwardly though his fortune had completely dwindled. \nA room in the house was set apart for Aouda. Aouda and Passepartout are both worried \nabout Fogg as they expect him to do something rash.<PARAGRAPH>Passepartout continues \nto feel guilty and even tells Fogg that he is sorry. But Fogg blames no one. The \nday passes by wearily. In the evening, Fogg meets Aouda and Fogg talks about giving \nsome money to her in order that she may maintain her position. As the course of \nthe conversation goes, Aouda asks Fogg whether he would like to have her as his \nwife. He confesses his own love for her. Passepartout is called and asked to give \ndue notice to the Reverend Samuel Wilson, so that Fogg and Aouda may be married \nthe next day, that is Monday.<PARAGRAPH>Notes\nThe tone of \nthis chapter is very mournful in the starting. The Savile Row house is not lit \nup, as any other ordinary house would be. The inmates look more serious than usual.<PARAGRAPH>Each has something to think about. Aouda is worried for Fogg as she thinks \nthat he might do something rash, Passepartout feels extremely guilty because he \nrealizes that he has put his master into a tight spot because of his lack of reasoning. \nHe even expresses this to Fogg, though the latter says that he blames no one. \nFogg is as impassive now, as he had been before. His only thoughts now are about \nthe future and how he should deal with it. He takes Aouda's responsibility on \nhis shoulders and sets out to make a duly beneficial plan for her. When Aouda \nand Fogg talk in the evening, Fogg is as rational as he always is. He explains \nhow he plans to provide for Aouda and while he is spouting statements and facts, \nAouda comes out with what is in her heart. She is truly a bold woman to be able \nto offer herself as Fogg's wife. Most women would have been too coy and shy to \ndo that. But, she does it in a bold and frank way that sweeps Fogg off his feet. \nHe too expresses his love for her and Aouda's heart overflows at this confession. \nFinally, the formidable man and the brave woman come together and decide to get \nmarried the next day.<PARAGRAPH>Passepartout is more than happy to see them come together. It is his dream come \ntrue. He is asked to go to the Reverend Samuel Wilson to arrange for the marriage \nto take place the next day, which they all think is Monday. After starting on \na sad note, the chapter seems to be ending in a more positive way.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141554/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Around_The_World_In_80_Days/Around_The_World_In_Eighty_Days32.html"}
