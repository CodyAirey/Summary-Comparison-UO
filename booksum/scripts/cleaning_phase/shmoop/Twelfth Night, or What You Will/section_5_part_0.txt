{"name": "Act 2, Scene 1", "summary": "On a sea coast  Antonio the sea captain asks Sebastian why he's leaving. Antonio also wants to know why he can't go with Sebastian. <PARAGRAPH>Sebastian says something like, \"Sorry man. It's not you, it's me. I'm in a really bad mood and I don't want to bum you out, so I think it's best for both of us if we go our separate ways. I would be a total jerk if I explained why I'm acting this way and unloaded all my problems on you - you don't deserve that so...\"<PARAGRAPH>Antonio cuts in and begs Sebastian to tell him where and why he's going away. <PARAGRAPH>The cryptic Sebastian says that he can't do it, and where he's going isn't important anyway. But, Antonio's such a great guy that he'll reveal his true identity. His name is \"Sebastian,\" not \"Roderigo,\" and he's really sad because he thinks his twin sister is dead.<PARAGRAPH>He also says that he would be dead too if Antonio hadn't scooped him up out of the ocean two hours after his ship sank and his sister drowned. <PARAGRAPH>Antonio says that's just awful and Sebastian replies that he doesn't want to stress out Antonio with his problems.<PARAGRAPH>Antonio begs Sebastian to let him be his servant, but Sebastian brushes him off and tells Antonio to forget he ever existed. Then Antonio says he doesn't want to cry like his mother always does, so he needs to be on his way to Duke Orsino's court.<PARAGRAPH>", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210614210248/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/twelfth-night/summary/act-2-scene-1"}
