{"name": "Volume 1, Chapter 6", "summary": "Everyone gets up before dawn again and it\u2019s so cold that the water inside is frozen, so they can\u2019t wash. At least the porridge is okay this morning.<PARAGRAPH>Jane starts having to actually do lessons with everyone else, which include sewing.<PARAGRAPH>While she\u2019s sewing, Jane watches another group of girls doing English history lessons with Miss Scatcherd. Remember that teacher who always picked on you for every little thing you did, including breathe? Well, that\u2019s how Miss Scatcherd is with Helen Burns. She doesn\u2019t like the way Helen stands, or the way she holds her head, or anything, even though Helen\u2019s really smart and good at her lessons.<PARAGRAPH>Eventually Miss Scatcherd gets angry enough about whatever it is that\u2019s biting her that she whips Helen\u2019s neck with a bundle of twigs.<PARAGRAPH>Jane wanders around alone during the free time in the evening, but she doesn\u2019t really feel bad; after all, her home at Gateshead was also horrible.<PARAGRAPH>Jane finds Helen and talks to her, learning her name for the first time. She can\u2019t understand why Helen isn\u2019t more upset about how Miss Scatcherd treats her; she knows she\u2019d freak out if she had been in Helen\u2019s place.<PARAGRAPH>Helen is disgustingly good and patient and reminds Jane about turning the other cheek and all that sort of thing. We\u2019re guessing she\u2019ll die young, because nobody this perfect ever lives to be forty.<PARAGRAPH>Helen agrees with all Miss Scatcherd\u2019s criticisms of her, which Jane thinks is just stupid, since Helen is obviously great. Helen admits to daydreaming quite a bit, but we don\u2019t think that\u2019s a fault. Plus, she daydreams about important history-lesson-type stuff, like why Charles I was a bad king.<PARAGRAPH>Helen does admit that Miss Temple treats her differently from Miss Scatcherd, but she says that\u2019s her own fault for being a better person when Miss Temple is around. Jane thinks, and we agree, that maybe Miss Temple is just a better teacher and a nicer person than Miss Scatcherd, but this hasn\u2019t occurred to Helen.<PARAGRAPH>Helen\u2019s \"love your enemies\" stuff starts to drive Jane crazy, and so Jane tells her about how impossible it is for her to love that harpy Mrs. Reed. After hearing the whole story, Helen\u2019s only answer is that Jane shouldn\u2019t let herself get so obsessed with being angry at Mrs. Reed.<PARAGRAPH>We don\u2019t know how exactly that\u2019s supposed to work, but Helen doesn\u2019t get a chance to explain, because she just got in trouble for something else.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210616205841/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/jane-eyre/summary/volume-1-chapter-6"}
