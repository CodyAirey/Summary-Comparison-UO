And while his crazy talk makes sense to the audience, the Portuguese guys just think he's nuts.<PARAGRAPH>From this point on, Hieronimo consistently sounds like madman. Has grief and the twisted path of revenge driven him mad or is he as Hamlet will later say, \"essentially [\u2026.] not in madness But mad in craft\" (Hamlet 3.4.191-2). Which is to say, \"I'm not really crazy, but I'm going to act like I am to throw everyone off my trail.\"<PARAGRAPH>This is a big question in the play, and perhaps the biggest question in Shakespeare's Hamlet.
