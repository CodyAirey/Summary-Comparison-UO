{"name": "Chapter 9", "summary": "You can guess what this chapter is about from the title. It's obviously Mrs. Morel that's doing the defeating, too.<PARAGRAPH>So, yeah. Paul resolves never to be with Miriam.<PARAGRAPH>Over time, Miriam senses his distance and starts to give up on the idea that she can sacrifice herself to Paul's love.<PARAGRAPH>One day, Paul does go to hang out with her at her house. While there, he acts like a total jerk to her. For instance, he tells her that she can't approach anything she loves without trying to suck the life out of it. Which is a bit harsh, don't you think?<PARAGRAPH>Finally, Miriam asks him why he's sad. He says he isn't sad, only normal.<PARAGRAPH>She persists, and he gets mad at her for asking. He picks up a stick and starts thrusting it into the earth . She asks him to stop doing it .<PARAGRAPH>He suddenly tells her that they need to break off their \"friendship.\" He's tired of the whole \"will they or won't they\" game.<PARAGRAPH>We are too.<PARAGRAPH>It's another week before Paul goes back to Willey farm. He starts taking comfort in hanging with Miriam's mom.<PARAGRAPH>I guess he's really got a thing for moms, not just his own.<PARAGRAPH>In Miriam and Paul's next conversation, Paul says it's not fair for him to visit her without intending to marry.<PARAGRAPH>Miriam just wishes other people would stop saying things and leave them alone.<PARAGRAPH>Paul asks Miriam if she thinks they should marry. Ball's in your court, Miriam. But she won't let him get away with asking-her-to-marry-him-without-really-asking-at-all, and says no.<PARAGRAPH>When they resolve not to be alone together, they realize that their lives won't actually change all that much.<PARAGRAPH>Before long, though, they're back alone again. What is with these two?<PARAGRAPH>Paul continues to give Miriam French lessons. One day, he messes up a romantic passage, and Miriam can feel the tension between them.<PARAGRAPH>She still clings to the belief that she's his main need in life.<PARAGRAPH>Miriam wants to prove that Paul needs her, so for some reason she invites him to Willey farm to come meet Mrs. Clara Dawes .<PARAGRAPH>Basically, Miriam thinks that if she puts a lower quality woman in front of Paul, he'll run back to her .<PARAGRAPH>Paul gets excited about meeting Clara, though.<PARAGRAPH>It's totally possible this plan could backfire.<PARAGRAPH>Paul leaves to go see Edgar in the fields. He talks to Edgar about Clara and makes fun of her negativity. They both agree  that they don't like her.<PARAGRAPH>We think Paul and Edgar doth protest too much.<PARAGRAPH>Paul goes back to hang with Clara and Miriam. He enjoys some witty repartee with Clara, as she's an independent, feminist type, and he's, well, a man of his times.<PARAGRAPH>Like, when the three of them go for a walk, Paul mentions how nice it'd be to be an old-school knight. And Clara says that he'd probably want all women to be shut up in their homes while he was off knighting it up. Haha.<PARAGRAPH>After this, Paul takes his mother to Lincoln. She looks frail sitting across from him in the railway carriage.<PARAGRAPH>He makes a joke about his mother being his girlfriend when they're out for dinner. Under the circumstances, it's not remotely funny.<PARAGRAPH>At one point, though, he actually gets angry at his mother for getting old, and not in a joking way.<PARAGRAPH>After a while, they get happy again over tea. He starts to tell her about Clara. Mrs. Morel wants to know why he likes her.<PARAGRAPH>He admits that he likes Clara's defiance, and probably wants to break her.<PARAGRAPH>Yikes.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Morel doesn't know what she wants for Paul, but she does know it's not Miriam or Clara.<PARAGRAPH>We also find out at this point that Annie is getting married.<PARAGRAPH>The wedding happens pretty much right away. Arthur comes home and looks great in his army uniform.<PARAGRAPH>No one really cares about any of this.<PARAGRAPH>Paul promises his mother that, unlike Annie, he'll live with her forever and never marry.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Morel says she doesn't want to leave him with no wife. He says she's only fifty-three, and still has plenty of time left.<PARAGRAPH>Cue the foreboding music.<PARAGRAPH>After Annie's married, Mrs. Morel buys Arthur out of the army. He is wild with joy, and becomes affectionate to her after this.<PARAGRAPH>One night, a woman named Beatrice comes over to smoke cigarettes with Arthur. She wants a puff of his, but he offers instead to blow smoke from his mouth into hers.<PARAGRAPH>Things get childhood flirty, and the two of them make out.<PARAGRAPH>To no one's surprise, Paul and Clara and Miriam hang out some more.<PARAGRAPH>Next, we read a letter from Paul to Miriam explaining they can never be physically intimate because they're just too different.<PARAGRAPH>In the letter, he calls Miriam a nun, which totally tears at Miriam's heart. She seals the letter and opens it one year later to show her mother.<PARAGRAPH>She writes back and says that their relationship would have been beautiful except for one little mistake, which she doesn't name. She asks, though, if the mistake was hers.<PARAGRAPH>Now, Paul's twenty-three and unattached. He's still a virgin, but he's been strongly stimulated by his relationship with Miriam.<PARAGRAPH>Often, as he speaks to Clara, he feels himself getting aroused. But he feels that his heart still belongs to Miriam.<PARAGRAPH>Paul's got ninety-nine problems, and women are at least three of them.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210506134332/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/sons-and-lovers/summary/chapter-9"}
