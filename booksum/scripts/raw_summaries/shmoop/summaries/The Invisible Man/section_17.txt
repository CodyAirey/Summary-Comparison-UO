{"name": "Chapter 18", "summary": "After Griffin makes sure the bedroom is secure and after Kemp promises not to turn him in, Griffin goes to sleep.<PARAGRAPH>Kemp can't sleep right now. For one thing, he's worried briefly about his sanity (was that really an invisible Griffin?). For another thing, Griffin took his bedroom.<PARAGRAPH>Instead, Kemp spends some time reading the newspapers from that day. The top news story is about a dangerous invisible man. Kemp remembers all the way back to Chapter 16 and he wonders why Griffin was chasing that tramp. That didn't look like innocent fun.<PARAGRAPH>Kemp worries that Griffin may become more unstable and dangerous. He hesitates, but eventually decides to write a note to Colonel Adye. (Perhaps it's a love letter? We won't find out until later.)<PARAGRAPH>Then he hears Griffin wake up. As usual, Griffin starts his day off by tossing some furniture around. It's good exercise \u2013 like yoga for mad scientists.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210623094503/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/invisible-man-wells/summary/chapter-18"}
