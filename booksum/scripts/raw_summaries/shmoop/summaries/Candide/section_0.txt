We\u2019d like to take this opportunity to give major props to Voltaire for creative names.<PARAGRAPH>Candide is the illegitimate son of the Baron\u2019s sister.<PARAGRAPH>Candide\u2019s mother refused to marry his father because his lineage could not be traced back sufficiently far.<PARAGRAPH>The daughter of the Baron and Baroness is a beauty named Cun\u00e9gonde, who, by our calculations, is Candide\u2019s cousin. Apparently, people didn\u2019t really care about that stuff back then.<PARAGRAPH>Candide is tutored by Pangloss, a scholar of metaphysico-theologo-cosmolo-nigology. Pangloss teaches that in the best of all possible worlds, everything is ultimately for the best, and that every effect has a cause.<PARAGRAPH>One evening, Cun\u00e9gonde and Candide meet behind a screen when leaving the dinner table. Cun\u00e9gonde drops her napkin and Candide picks it up for her.<PARAGRAPH>They share a kiss before Cun\u00e9gonde\u2019s father catches them and flips out. He banishes Candide.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201024064035/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/candide/summary/chapter-1"}
