{"name": "Chapter 5", "summary": "Not quite an \"I'm king of the world!\" moment, but the man with the weed in his hat is standing against the railing on the side of the boat. Just doing his own thing.<PARAGRAPH>At the moment, doing his own thing means indulging in the goodness of human nature. The narrator takes a minute here to contemplate the nature of showing gratitude, how tricky it can be to look grateful when you've got a sense of pride, and how uncomfortable it can be when people are too enthusiastic in their thanks. Awkward.<PARAGRAPH>There's another dude leaning against the railing. The narrator has us side-eye him. We learn that he's got a book, he's young, he's probably in college, he's wearing a frou-frou shirt, and he's probably a sophomore.<PARAGRAPH>Weeds is the first to speak, with a ZOMG, did I mumble so loudly you heard me? OMG how embarrassing, but I can see you're sad, too. Let's be sad friends.<PARAGRAPH>Schoolboy is too taken aback to say anything, but no need--for the rest of the chapter, Weeds basically takes over the whole conversation. The topic? Why this kid should abandon his book on Tacitus . Hint: it's because after reading it, the kid will never trust his fellow man again.<PARAGRAPH>We're sensing a theme here.<PARAGRAPH>Weeds finally asks if the kid would trust him.<PARAGRAPH>Confused, the kid walks away.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20211017011430/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/confidence-man/summary/chapter-5"}
