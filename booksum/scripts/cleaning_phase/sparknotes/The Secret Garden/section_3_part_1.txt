{"name": "Chapter V", "summary": "Chapter V Mary passes a number of weeks in which each of her days is like the others: she awakens, eats breakfast, and then wanders the moor all day. Her time out of doors begins to cause a change in her: she slowly begins to grow stronger and healthier, and her imagination, which had laid dormant during her time in India, is quickened by her exploration of the manor grounds and her search for the secret garden. Outside one of Misselthwaite's walled gardens, Mary has a second encounter with Ben Weatherstaff's robin. She is terribly pleased to see him, and chases after the robin as he flies along the garden wall--she even goes so far as to chirp and whistle at him, even though she does not know how. In her pursuit of the robin, she becomes certain that he lives in the secret garden. She cannot, however, find its door. That night, Martha tells Mary further stories of the secret garden, even though Master Craven has forbidden the servants to discuss it. The garden once belonged to Mrs. Craven, and she and her husband had spent many intimate hours there in the years of their marriage. It had been Mrs. Craven's custom to sit in a rose-covered bower at the top of one of the garden's trees, and, one day, she fell from it when a branch gave way. She died of her injuries, and, after her death, Archibald Craven could no longer bear the garden and had it locked shut. Hearing this story, Mary feels a great pity for her uncle. As she listens to the wind blowing over the moor, she is able to discern another sound beneath it: the sound of someone, a child, crying. Martha denies hearing any such sound, though Mary does not believe her", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210124225111/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/secretgarden/section4/"}
