{"name": "Scene 2", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210416215230/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmOthello20.asp", "summary": "Othello writes a report to Venice that the danger from the Turks is over. He sends Iago away to post the mail. Othello then goes to inspect the fortifications, telling Iago to meet him later.", "analysis": "Notes This very short exchange between Othello and Iago shows Othello assuming his public duties with Iago, who is treated as a trusted deputy. Othello's first concern is still to appropriately perform his duties in Cyprus. The brevity of the scene contributes to the impression of swiftly moving action."}
