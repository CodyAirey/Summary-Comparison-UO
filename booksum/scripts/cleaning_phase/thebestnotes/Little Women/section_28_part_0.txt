{"name": "chapter 30", "summary": "Amy works at the Chester fair where she initially helps to set up the \n        art table. May Chester is jealous of Amy's items and convinces her mother \n        to take the table away from her and send her to a less popular flower \n        table that is slightly out of the mainstream of the traffic.<PARAGRAPH>Amy's first day is miserable as the young girls who are supposed to \n        work with her are more of a hindrance than a help. The flowers wilt and \n        she makes few sales. She goes home hurt and discouraged but resolves that \n        she will not show it. The next day she carries out several acts of kindness \n        and generosity toward May Chester. Her behavior is noted, but she still \n        has a difficult day as her helpers desert her and her flowers wilt in \n        the hot sun.<PARAGRAPH>On the last day of the fair, Laurie and his friends come to Amy's rescue. \n        Hayes, the Laurence's gardener sends her the best flowers of the garden; \n        then Laurie appears with all of his gentlemen friends and they buy everything \n        that Amy has. Once she has sold out, Amy orders the young men to go to \n        the art table and buy May's painted vases.<PARAGRAPH>The fair is pronounced a success. A week later Amy receives her reward \n        in the form of a letter from Aunt March. Aunt Carrol is going abroad with \n        cousin Flo and has asked Amy to go with them. Jo is heartbroken, but remembers \n        the rude and saucy words that brought the invitation to Amy rather than \n        to herself.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025235/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Little_Women_Alcott/Little_Women_Study_Guide15.html"}
