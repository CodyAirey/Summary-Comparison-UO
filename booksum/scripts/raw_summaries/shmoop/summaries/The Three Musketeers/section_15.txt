{"name": "Chapter Fifteen: Men of the Robe and Men of the Sword", "summary": "Several days pass and Athos is still missing. D\u2019Artagnan and Porthos fill Tr\u00e9ville in on what\u2019s happened. (Aramis is out of town on family business.)<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville instantly tries to find out where Athos is being held. That would be the Fort l\u2019Eveque.<PARAGRAPH>He\u2019s been subjected to all the same interrogations as Bonacieux. He handles himself well in these interrogations, however, and succeeds in confusing his commissary so much that he gets sent to the Louvre to be questioned by the Cardinal.<PARAGRAPH>The Cardinal is busy, but this is the precise moment that Tr\u00e9ville arrives in the palace.<PARAGRAPH>Now we have some background.<PARAGRAPH>The King is very suspicious of his wife, and it doesn\u2019t help that the Cardinal fans the flames of jealousy. Anne\u2019s friendship with Madame de Chevreuse doesn\u2019t help matters either.<PARAGRAPH>Side bar: Although we\u2019ve heard the name \"Madame de Chevreuse\" before, and even know she\u2019s a duchess, we didn\u2019t know much else. Now, however, we learn that she\u2019s the Queen\u2019s best friend.<PARAGRAPH>Now, even though France is at war with Spain, on the brink of war with England, and practically broke, the Cardinal\u2019s biggest worry is this friendship between the Queen and Madame de Chevreuse.<PARAGRAPH>The Cardinal tells the King that Madame de Chevreuse had been in Paris, that the Queen has continued some mysterious letter-writing, and that he was in the process of arresting the go-between linking the Queen to her exiled friend (that would be Madame Bonacieux), when he was interrupted by a Musketeer.<PARAGRAPH>Whew. Once more, just for clarity\u2019s sake: the King hates his wife\u2019s friend, who is in exile. Madame Bonacieux has been the go-between linking the two friends. The Cardinal was about to arrest her when a Musketeer intervened.<PARAGRAPH>So at this point the King is raging mad at his Musketeers and at his wife. (Notice that the Cardinal hasn\u2019t even said anything about the Duke of Buckingham!)<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville arrives just as the King is getting angry about the actions of the Musketeers.<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville, however, is unfazed and says that he wants to talk about the behavior of the Cardinal\u2019s guard. He points out that Athos was arrested in a very unseemly fashion. He also points out that Athos has served the King multiple times.<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville and the Cardinal continue to battle for the King\u2019s good opinion, and Tr\u00e9ville finally wins after he swears up and down that D\u2019Artagnan was with him at 9:30pm. The Cardinal believes Tr\u00e9ville is a man of such integrity that he wouldn\u2019t lie about this. (Of course, neither man knows that the hero of the story altered the clock!)<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville demands that Athos be released from prison or else put on trial. He also threatens to resign if his Musketeers are suspected of wrongdoing.<PARAGRAPH>The Cardinal insists on a trial, and Tr\u00e9ville says he plans on pleading on Athos\u2019s behalf. The King, fed up, asks Tr\u00e9ville to swear that Athos was with him that night. Tr\u00e9ville does so.<PARAGRAPH>The Cardinal tells the King that if they release Athos, they will never know the true story. Tr\u00e9ville points out that Athos can always be found for further questioning.<PARAGRAPH>The King signs an order for Athos\u2019s release, and although Tr\u00e9ville looks happy, he\u2019s concerned that the Cardinal has more tricks up his sleeve.<PARAGRAPH>Still, Tr\u00e9ville releases Athos from prison. When Athos sees D\u2019Artagnan he warns him (D\u2019Artagnan) that the Cardinal will still try to retaliate.<PARAGRAPH>Back at the palace, as soon as Tr\u00e9ville left the Cardinal turned to the King and asked if he knew that the Duke of Buckingham was recently in town.<PARAGRAPH>That Cardinal sure knows how to push the King\u2019s buttons!", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210624190147/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/three-musketeers/summary/chapter-fifteen-men-of-the-robe-and-men-of-the-sword"}
