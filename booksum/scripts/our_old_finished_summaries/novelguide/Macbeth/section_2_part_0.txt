Full of determination and love for her husband, she resolves to convince Macbeth to carry through with the planned murders. She says that Macbeth is too kind and gentle to commit such an act, whereas she is more morally courageous and daring.

Momentarily aghast, Lady Macbeth realizes that this is her chance to kill Duncan. She prays for confidence and unwavering resolve so that she can carry through with her evil intentions.
