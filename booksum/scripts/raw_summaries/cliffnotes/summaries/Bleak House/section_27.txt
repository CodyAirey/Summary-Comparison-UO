{"name": "Chapter 30", "summary": "Caddy Jellyby and Prince Turveydrop have a church wedding; Esther and Ada serve as bridesmaids. The newlyweds are to have a week's honeymoon at Gravesend (a seaport in southeast England). Allan Woodcourt's mother mentions to Esther that her son, Allan, has the \"fault\" of paying attention to girls in whom he has no real interest. The wedding guests include a Miss Wisk, a fanatic on the subject of women's emancipation.<PARAGRAPH>", "analysis": "The \"happy ending\" for Caddy and Prince foreshadows the happy marriage later on of Esther and Allan Woodcourt. The mention of Allan prevents readers from forgetting about a character who will become more and more important but who is not now a part of the action.\nA traditionalist on the subject of the family, and a critic of all fanaticism, Dickens takes the opportunity to satirize a proponent of women's liberation.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201101003913/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/b/bleak-house/summary-and-analysis/chapter-30"}
