{"name": "chapter 27", "summary": "Hands rises just once in a lather \nof foam and blood before he sinks. This sight together with the pain of the wound, \ncaused by Hands dagger, sickens Jim. What terrifies Jim most is the thought of \nfalling into the water. He manages to regain his composure and learns that the \nknife wasn't stuck very deep. He pulls it out with a jerk and tries to regain \nhis composure over himself. The wound bleeds profusely. As he looks around he \nsees the only companion he is left with is dead O\u0092Brien. Jim gets rid of his body \nas well.<PARAGRAPH>It is almost evening. Jim has difficulty controlling the ship. \nHe can\u0092t do much and he leaves the fate of the ship on luck, just like himself. \nFew minutes pass by and suddenly Jim notices that the ship is in shallow waters. \nFinally Jim steps on land. He can\u0092t wait to get to the stockade to tell them about \nhis achievement. He thinks that the news of recapturing the Hispaniola would \nmake them happy.<PARAGRAPH>Jim finds the topography of the land quite familiar. \nHe is familiar with Captain Kid's anchorage, the two peaks on his left and the \nplace where he met Ben Gunn for the first time. He notices a glow of fire against \nthe sky and presumes that someone is cooking supper. The night grows darker and \ndarker. Strange sounds in the jungle fill Jim\u0092s ears. Jim notices firewood burning \nand notices a strangeness in the way it is lit. Terror strikes him. He wonders \nif anything wrong has happened at the stockade in his absence.<PARAGRAPH>He draws \na little closer on his knees. He hears, as Jim says, the sweet sound of his friend \nsnoring. He was sure that nothing had gone wrong, for it were Silver\u0092s men he \nwouldn\u0092t have lived to tell the story. As he doesn\u0092t find a sentry, he blames \nhimself for this, as he had run away from his duty. Suddenly he trips on a leg \nas he made his way to the sleeping place allotted to him by his Captain. A shrill \nvoice breaks the silence. It is Captain\u0092s Flint, Silver\u0092s parrot. This scream \nawakens the sleeping men. Jim knows he was in the wrong camp. As he tries to make \nhis way back, he is held by a tight hand. He sees his end near when he hears Silver \nshouting for a torch to recognize the intruder. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Your browser does not support the IFRAME tag.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Treasure_Island/Treasure_Island31.html"}
