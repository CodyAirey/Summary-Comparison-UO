{"name": "Volume II, Chapter Nineteen \u2013 An Opinion", "summary": "It\u2019s the tenth day after Lucie\u2019s wedding.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Lorry enters the doctor\u2019s bedroom and finds the doctor sitting by his window, reading.<PARAGRAPH>He\u2019s a bit pale, sure, but otherwise he seems to be completely back to normal.<PARAGRAPH>The change is so drastic, in fact, that Mr. Lorry begins to doubt his own eyes.<PARAGRAPH>When Miss Pross arrives, she\u2019s equally astonished.<PARAGRAPH>Dr. Manette seems to have healed himself completely overnight.<PARAGRAPH>Because the doctor doesn\u2019t make any reference to his scary relapse, Miss Pross and Mr. Lorry decide not to mention it immediately, either.<PARAGRAPH>They all head down to breakfast.<PARAGRAPH>While they\u2019re sitting down, Mr. Lorry tells Dr. Manette that he needs an expert\u2019s opinion for a hypothetical case.<PARAGRAPH>We all know  how much Mr. Lorry loves \"hypothetical\" cases.<PARAGRAPH>Asking the doctor how good friends should deal with the case of a man who relapsed for nine days, Mr. Lorry tries to gauge how much the doctor actually remembers of his relapse.<PARAGRAPH>As it turns out, the doctor doesn\u2019t remember anything.<PARAGRAPH>He quickly catches on to Mr. Lorry\u2019s ruse; finally, he asks if the daughter of this hypothetical man has been told of his illness.<PARAGRAPH>When Mr. Lorry says that the daughter hasn\u2019t been told of her father\u2019s condition, Dr. Manette breathes a huge sigh of relief.<PARAGRAPH>Actually, he says, the man probably has been expecting a relapse of this sort for some time.<PARAGRAPH>Puzzled, Mr. Lorry asks why.<PARAGRAPH>Dr. Manette pauses for a bit before replying.<PARAGRAPH>He finally says that the man had probably been anticipating some information from someone he knew well.<PARAGRAPH>Actually, anticipating is too nice a word. He\u2019d been dreading the information.<PARAGRAPH>When it finally came, his mind crumbled entirely.<PARAGRAPH>Surprised, Mr. Lorry asks what the information was.<PARAGRAPH>The doctor, of course, can\u2019t say. After all, it\u2019s a hypothetical case.<PARAGRAPH>He does reassure Mr. Lorry that another relapse seems highly unlikely.<PARAGRAPH>After all, there are no more big shocks in store. Thank goodness.<PARAGRAPH>Now comes the tricky part: Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross have come up with a plan.<PARAGRAPH>They\u2019re pretty sure that the doctor won\u2019t like it at all.<PARAGRAPH>Nevertheless, they decide to give it a go.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Lorry gently tells the doctor that the case they\u2019d been discussing also involved some tools: the man who relapsed began working again at shoemaking.<PARAGRAPH>The doctor seems more disturbed than before.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Lorry asks if it wouldn\u2019t be best for the friends of the man to take the shoemaking bench away.<PARAGRAPH>After all, couldn\u2019t the very presence of the bench in the man\u2019s room help to incite another relapse?<PARAGRAPH>Pained by this thought, the doctor explains that the bench was once the only thing that kept him sane.<PARAGRAPH>He worked with his hands (making shoes) so that he wouldn\u2019t go crazy while he was in prison.<PARAGRAPH>In some ways, then, the bench symbolizes his strength, not his weakness.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Lorry understands this, but he still presses the doctor to get rid of the bench.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, the doctor agrees that if the bench could be taken away while the man was out of the house, it might be okay.<PARAGRAPH>Accordingly, a few days later the doctor heads out to the country to meet up with Darnay and Lucie.<PARAGRAPH>As soon as he leaves, Miss Pross and Mr. Lorry dismantle his workbench and bury the tools in the yard.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210115212823/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/tale-of-two-cities/summary/volume-2-chapter-19"}
