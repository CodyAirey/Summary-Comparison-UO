Siddhartha treats him with consideration and respect although he realizes the boy has been spoiled by a wealthy lifestyle.<PARAGRAPH>Siddhartha struggles to try to win his son\u2019s love and acceptance with kindness, but his efforts are in vain.<PARAGRAPH>His son came to the river out of necessity, not desire. The kid wants out of the boondocks.<PARAGRAPH>Siddhartha wishes desperately to protect his son from pain and suffering, but is reminded by Vasudeva and the wisdom of the river that one cannot teach certain things. They must be learned through experience.<PARAGRAPH>Although Siddhartha understands the concept, his love for his son is overwhelming. He cannot bear to let the boy go.<PARAGRAPH>Siddhartha\u2019s son feels trapped by his father\u2019s endless kindness.

He enters the town sad, but no longer worried, and stands near the gate where he first saw Kamala. He relives the moments of his life and feels a sense of profound emptiness.<PARAGRAPH>He crouches by the gate in meditation on the hot, dusty road.<PARAGRAPH>A monk from Kamala\u2019s garden places two bananas in front of him (which, it seems, is a generous meal by the book\u2019s standards), but Siddhartha is deep in meditation and doesn\u2019t notice.<PARAGRAPH>Vasudeva finds Siddhartha. Siddhartha greets him happily and they return home. Neither speaks of the boy.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20220323195157/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/siddhartha/summary/chapter-10"}
