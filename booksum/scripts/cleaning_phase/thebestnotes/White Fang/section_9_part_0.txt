{"name": "chapter 2", "summary": "White Fang has completely \ngiven himself up to the mercy of the man-animals, his gods. He learns the nature \nof the Indians and their sense of justice and power. He learns to avoid the mothers \nof half-grown puppies, due to a few bad experiences with them. He still fights \nwith Lip-lip and is defeated every time. Once, he lures Lip-lip towards Kiche, \nwho, although tied, leaps upon him and injures him badly. White Fang, too, sinks \nhis teeth into Lip-lips hind leg.<PARAGRAPH>Kiche is released by Gray Beaver. Mother \nand son are now together, much to Lip-lips disappointment. White Fang tries to \nentice his mother into the woods but fails, for Kiche is comfortable in the camp. \nWhite Fang inevitably follows her there. However, Kiche is soon sent away with \nanother Indian, Three Eagles, as payment for a debt that Gray Beaver owes him. \nA strip of scarlet cloth, a bearskin, twenty cartridges, and Kiche will go with \nThree Eagles up the Mackenzie River to the Great Slave Lake. White Fang follows \nKiche into the water and heads after the canoe, but a blow from Three Eagles forces \nhim back. Ignoring Gray Beavers calls, he continues to swim behind the canoe. \nGray Beaver pursues White Fang in a canoe, overtakes him, lifts him by the nape \nof his neck, and beats him. White Fang bites back, only to be beaten harder. He \nlearns an important lesson; never bite a human. Ashore, he is bitten by Lip-lip, \nwho is beaten by Gray Beaver. White Fang limps behind Gray Beaver to the Indian \nvillage, where he must learn to adjust a life without his mother. As time passes, \nhe still yearns for Kiche, but he grows comfortable in camp. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Your browser does not support the IFRAME tag.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025238/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/White_Fang/White_Fang15.html"}
