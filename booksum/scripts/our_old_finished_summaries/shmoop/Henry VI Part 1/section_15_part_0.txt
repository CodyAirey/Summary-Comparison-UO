He comes to the French town of Bordeaux and demands surrender. Bordeaux says it will fight back, and on top of that, ten thousand French warriors have promised to shoot at no one but Talbot. Good times. The spokesman for the French says he is pretty impressed with Talbot's courage, but Talbot will be dead within an hour.
