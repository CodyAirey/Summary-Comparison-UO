{"name": "Chapter 28", "summary": "Margaret spends hours thinking over everything that's happened, then writes a bunch of letters.<PARAGRAPH>The first is to Henry; she writes it instinctively, saying that everything will be fine between them, then edits it according to his taste. He's clearly changed her.<PARAGRAPH>Margaret then reevaluates, and wonders if she really can deal with the fact that Mr. Wilcox had an affair with Jacky. She tears up the letter she just wrote.<PARAGRAPH>Next, she writes a brief note to Leonard, saying that Mr. Wilcox can't get him a job.<PARAGRAPH>She also writes a letter to Helen, telling her that they found Jacky drunk, and that the Basts are not worth her while - she should ditch them, and come to stay with the Wilcoxes at the house.<PARAGRAPH>Margaret feels like she's handling the matters in a practical fashion. She delivers the letters to the hotel herself, and sees Helen watching her through the window.<PARAGRAPH>She goes to inform Henry of what she's done, telling him that Helen is coming to spend the night.<PARAGRAPH>They act like nothing's happened, but obviously, something important has.<PARAGRAPH>Margaret tries to decide if she can stay with Henry or not. She goes back and forth between anger and pity - and ultimately decides to forgive him.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219165520/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/howards-end/summary/chapter-28"}
