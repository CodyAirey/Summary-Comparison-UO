{"name": "volume 1, Chapter IX", "summary": "PARAGRAPH>Chapter IX, pages 72-80<PARAGRAPH>Wentworth visits Uppercross almost every day. His presence bothers Charles Hayter, a Musgrove cousin, who has Henrietta in his sights as a wife. Henrietta seemed agreeable to that arrangement, until Captain Wentworth showed up to compete for her attention. Anne cannot determine which sister, Henrietta or Louisa, is Wentworth's favorite, and she must listen to the confidential speculations of Mary and Charles about which sister has the upper hand. Mary tells Anne that she thinks it would be beneath Henrietta to marry Charles Hayter, who is only a curate, when she might capture rich Captain Wentworth. PARAGRAPH>One morning, Wentworth comes to the cottage in search of Henrietta and Louisa, but instead he finds Anne alone with her mending nephew. When a younger nephew comes into the room and climbs on Anne's back to play, Anne cannot get the child to let go of her. Charles, who has come in to read the paper, admonishes the child, but to no avail. It is Captain Wentworth who in a flash removes the child from Anne's back. She is touched by his gallant behavior toward her, but she is also abashed that he avoids her thanks. It takes Anne a long time to recover her composure after this encounter. PARAGRAPH>Analysis<PARAGRAPH>Captain Wentworth's behavior shows that he still has some feelings for Anne. Beneath his gallantry--which he might perform for any woman--lies a concern for Anne's welfare, a tenderness that he immediately hides by pretending that the rescue was nothing to him, a deed not even worthy of her thanks", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210213065256/https://www.novelguide.com/persuasion/summaries/volume1-chapter8to10"}
