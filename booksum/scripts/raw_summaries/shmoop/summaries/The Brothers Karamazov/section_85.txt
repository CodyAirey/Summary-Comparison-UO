He argues that Dmitri was just deeply resentful of his father, over his inheritance and over their romantic rivalry for Grushenka. (Kirillovich again cites Rakitin to support his depiction of Dmitri's \"Karamazovian\" passion for Grushenka.)<PARAGRAPH>As evidence of premeditation, he brings up the fact that Dmitri had shouted about his plans to kill and rob his father for months.<PARAGRAPH>The prosecutor finally turns to the events of the night of the murder, in which he paints a decidedly more sympathetic picture of Madame Khokhlakov's behavior.
