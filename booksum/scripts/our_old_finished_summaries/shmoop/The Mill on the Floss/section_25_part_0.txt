The sale of the Tulliver's furniture occurs and Mr. Tulliver is insensible during it. The family stay upstairs during the sale. The maid then comes to get Tom, since he has a visitor downstairs. The visitor is Bob Jakin, who Tom doesn't recognize at first. Tom is sad to see all the family belongings gone, except for the family Bible and a few pieces of furniture. Bob is a little chatterbox and he rambles on about how he liked Tom a bunch when they were kids and still considers him a friend. Maggie comes downstairs now and is dismayed to see all the family belongings gone. She is particularly upset to see that most of the books were sold. Bob rambles on some more and explains that he heard about the Tulliver's troubles and decided to come to help them. Bob works as a packman, which is basically a traveling salesman. He recently earned a good bit of money and he tries to give the Tullivers some of it. Tom and Maggie are deeply touched, but they tell Bob that they really can't take his money. Bob is disappointed, but says that he'll always be their friend and to let him know if they need anything.", "analysis": ""}
