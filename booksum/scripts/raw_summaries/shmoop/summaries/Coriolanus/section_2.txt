In fact, she hopes he gets maimed in the process so he can come home and show off his \"bloody brow\" and some awesome new scars.<PARAGRAPH>Now Virgilia's BFF, Valeria, shows up. (Don't freak if you're confused by all these \"V\" names because you're not alone. Literary critics often refer to these female characters as the \"three V's.\")<PARAGRAPH>Valeria makes small talk about Virgilia's adorable little boy. He did the cutest thing the other day\u2014he tortured a butterfly before tearing it apart with his teeth.<PARAGRAPH>The women are all \"How precious! Like father like son.\"<PARAGRAPH>Valeria invites the ladies out for the ancient Roman equivalent of \"lunch with the girls.\"<PARAGRAPH>Virgilia refuses. She can't bear to leave the house when her beloved hubby is risking life and limb. She'll just stay at home and keep sewing.<PARAGRAPH>Valeria is all \"Who do you think you are: Penelope?<PARAGRAPH>Brain Snack: Penelope is maybe the most famous wife in literary history. In Homer's  Odyssey, she stays at home pretend-weaving while her man is out having an epic adventure. Valeria obviously thinks this is major loser territory.<PARAGRAPH>Now Valeria reports that she heard some news about the war\u2014apparently, Caius Martius and Titus Lartius are giving the city of Corioles a good old fashioned Roman beating. Meanwhile, on the battlefields between Rome and Corioles, another general (Cominius) is leading some Roman soldiers against the Volscians.<PARAGRAPH>Virgilia is happy to hear all this but she won't budge. Finally, her mother-in-law and BFF leave without her.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200921130811/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/coriolanus/summary/act-1-scene-3"}
