{"name": "volume 3, Chapter 42", "summary": "Chapter 42: After Mrs. Elton had talked so much about her sister and brother-in-law visiting, it turns out they cannot visit. It is decided that they will all take a trip to Box Hill  anyway. When a horse goes lame they make the plan of going to Donwell  instead. Mrs. Elton tries to take charge over who will be invited and what it will be like, but Knightley will not have it, and says that he will take care of it. The horse gets better, and it is decided that they will go to Donwell one day and Box Hill the next. The day at Donwell goes well, and at one point, Emma overhears Mrs. Elton tell Jane that she found her a position. Jane is sorry that she went to the trouble, as she will not accept it, but Mrs. Elton tries to talk her into it. Jane suggests they all walk around the gardens. They do, and Emma sees Mr. Knightley and Harriet walking together. Then they eat, and Mrs. Weston is worried that Frank, who was to meet them there, has not yet arrived. The party goes out to walk again, and Emma stays in the house with her father. She is surprised when Jane returns, saying that she wants to be alone and is going to walk back home. A bit later Frank shows up, and Emma sees that he is quite cranky, and he blames it on the heat. She invites him to go to Box Hill the next day, and while he at first says he will not, he later decides to go", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210421073237/http://www.novelguide.com/emma/summaries/chap40-42"}
