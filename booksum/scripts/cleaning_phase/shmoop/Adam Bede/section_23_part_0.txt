{"name": "Chapter 24", "summary": "Now you get to see how Hayslope parties. Dinner has ended and \"the great cask of birthday ale\" has just been trotted out .<PARAGRAPH>Fortunately, all Eliot's characters know how to hold their liquor . There will be no drunken brawls, just good, clean, orderly speeches.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Poyser--and a nervous Mr. Poyser, at that--is the first to speak. He's no JFK, but he does a good job of thanking Arthur for his hospitality.<PARAGRAPH>Next Arthur stands up. He thanks Mr. Poyser, praises the local farmers as kind and knowledgeable men, proposes a toast for old Squire Irwine, and--and actually, that's about it. Short but sweet.<PARAGRAPH>Even though \"they hated the old squire,\" the farmers toast him at Arthur's bidding . Arthur can do better than that. So he announces that Adam will be taking charge of the Donnithorne woods. There's a big, enthusiastic toast.<PARAGRAPH>Now Mr. Irwine gets up to speak. He speaks of Hayslope's values of community and hard work. And of one model resident of Hayslope--Adam Bede. Mr. Irwine declares that he respects Adam \"as much as I respect any man living\" . Again, a huge toast follows.<PARAGRAPH>Adam gets up to thank everybody. But he's slightly abashed. As he describes himself, he's simply a hardworking guy who \"wishes to do the right thing, and to leave the world a bit better than he found it\" .<PARAGRAPH>It's been a good ceremony, but not 100% good. Some women heard Adam's speech and thought he \"didn't show himself thankful enough\" . And Hetty, sitting in the crowd, feels like Arthur is slighting her and neglecting her on his big day. Other than that, it's been a good ceremony.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210630082925/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/adam-bede/summary/chapter-24"}
