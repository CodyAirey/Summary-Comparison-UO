{"name": "chapter twenty-three: fire rises", "summary": "A week after the storming of the Bastille, Defarge enters the wine shop. He \n        tells the others that Foulon, an aristocrat who faked his own death to \n        protect himself, is still alive. Some villagers have found him hiding \n        in the country and have brought him in for trial. As the drums start beating \n        in the street, Madame Defarge grabs her knife. Outside, a fierce woman \n        called The Vengeance utters terrific shrieks and flails her arms. She \n        rushes from house to house, arousing all the women and whipping them into \n        a fury for the blood of Foulon. As the crowd rushes to the Hall of Justice, \n        the Defarges, the Vengeance, and Jacques Three are right in front. The \n        mob, unable to wait for the trial to end, rushes in to the building and \n        drags Foulon out. They hang him from a lamppost outside the Hall of Justice \n        and stuff his mouth full of grass, for he had suggested that this was \n        an appropriate food for the peasants. The patriots, as the revolutionaries \n        now call themselves, then decapitate him and display Foulon\u0092s head for \n        all to see.<PARAGRAPH>The road-mender's village sees a great deal of change, with frequent visits from the patriots; but the villagers remain poor \nand hungry. One night a patriot meets with the road-mender. Later, the two of them, joined by two others, travel out of \nthe village and burn down the Evremonde chateau.<PARAGRAPH>A village mob assembles and watches the burning image in grim satisfaction; \n        the town officials, such as Gabelle the tax collector, stand by helpless \n        against this mob. The assembled villagers imprison Gabelle and threaten \n        his life since he was a faithful friend of the Evremondes. Since daylight \n        approaches fast, the mob disperses, and Gabelle\u0092s life is spared.<PARAGRAPH>For three years, the violent storm continues around the Bastille with the mob growing more unruly. Many of the \naristocrats escape from France; those that do not escape are captured and killed by the guillotine. The king has been \nsuspended from his office, and the government is in chaos and paralysis. The only real law is the will of the general \npublic, which is lawless.<PARAGRAPH>Many of the expatriate French aristocrats flee to London. They begin to gather at Tellson's Bank in order to transact \nbusiness and hear the latest news of events in their own country. One day in August of 1792, Darnay is in the bank trying, \nin vain, to dissuade Mr. Lorry from going over to Paris to safeguard the bank\u0092s French interests. While Darnay is in the \nbank, a letter arrives that is addressed to him by his proper name, Marquis St. Evremonde. Since no one in London outside \nthe immediate family knows of Darnay\u0092s true identity, inquiries are made as to the whereabouts of this marquis. None of \nthe French noblemen in the bank seem to know who this person is. Darnay volunteers to deliver the letter himself.<PARAGRAPH>When Darnay leaves the bank, he opens the letter. It is from Gabelle, the old, faithful servant of the Evremondes. He has \nbeen imprisoned and is going to be tried for treason against the people. He begs Darnay to come and save him, since the \nonly crime he committed was to follow Darnay's orders. Darnay is deeply moved by the letter and realizes that he has not \ndone all that he intended about the abandonment of his estate and social rank. He realizes that he should have been \npresent in person and supervised the plans for relieving the tenants of their heavy debts. He had given Gabelle written \ninstructions to spare the people and give them what little there was to give. Darnay himself had neither oppressed nor \nimprisoned anyone.<PARAGRAPH>Darnay decides to go back to Paris to save Gabelle and to try undo some of \n        the wrongs done by his family. He is also stirred by the fact that Mr. \n        Lorry is bravely going to Paris merely to look after the interests of \n        the bank. He has no sense of the danger that Paris poses for him and naively \n        believes that his good intentions will be gratefully acknowledged by the \n        Revolutionists. Darnay leaves for France without informing anyone about \n        his departure, but he immediately sends a letter of explanation to his \n        family.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Dickens/A_Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Study_Guide21.html"}
