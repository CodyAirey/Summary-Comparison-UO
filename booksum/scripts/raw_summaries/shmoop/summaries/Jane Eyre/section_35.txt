{"name": "Volume 3, Chapter 10", "summary": "St. John slips a note under Jane\u2019s door in the morning; he can tell she was ready to sacrifice everything and become his wife and fellow missionary, and he\u2019ll ask her again when he comes back in two weeks.<PARAGRAPH>After St. John leaves, Jane thinks about the supernatural voice and wonders where it came from. She decides she must know what\u2019s going on with Rochester, wherever he is.<PARAGRAPH>Jane arranges a journey back to Thornfield; after thirty-six hours, she arrives at an inn called the Rochester Arms. She can\u2019t bring herself to ask anyone there about him, so she just starts walking to Thornfield.<PARAGRAPH>Jane comes up toward Thornfield walking along the wall of the orchard. She peeks out from around a corner of the wall... and sees a complete ruin.<PARAGRAPH>It\u2019s burned down, blackened and collapsed. She compares it to a man sneaking up to peek at the face of his sleeping beloved and finding her dead.<PARAGRAPH>Shocked, Jane goes back to the inn and asks the host what happened. From him she learns the whole story of what happened: Bertha burned down the house in the middle of the night by setting fire to what used to be Jane\u2019s own bed.<PARAGRAPH>Rochester saved the servants and then climbed up to a high wall where Bertha was standing to try to rescue her, but she jumped off and committed suicide. Rochester was blinded and lost a hand when the wall collapsed.<PARAGRAPH>Jane asks where Rochester is now, and the innkeeper tells her that he\u2019s at his other home, Ferndean. Jane arranges to go there in a chaise right away.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210616205841/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/jane-eyre/summary/volume-3-chapter-10"}
