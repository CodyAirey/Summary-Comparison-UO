Talone and Ani persuade the stable-master to give them some horses to ride on their journey. As luck would have it, many of the horses are already gone with the king and his men, so Ani gets stuck with the bay that Geric had trouble with on the first day. The stable-master doesn't think it's a good idea, but Ani insists. And they're off--with horses, clothes, and the location, the group all head to the king's other estate. As they ride, Talone reassures Ani that she's got the truth on her side, but Ani's worried about Selia's people-speaking gift. They talk over the impending war, and everyone realizes that Bayern will crush Kildenree like a bug if it goes forward. Enna asks Ani to tell them a story about war, so Ani recites one about women going to battle and men crying \"vanquished!\" Finn feels a little uneasy with the story, but Enna comforts him. Ani tells everyone to be careful--she doesn't want anyone to take risks because of her. Hey, Ani--it's a little late for that, don't you think? The next morning, Ani bathes in the river to get the layer of dirt off her body, and then she gets dressed in the green dress she took from Selia's room. Everyone recognizes that she is a princess when they see her; she's no longer a goose girl telling a story, but real-life, bona fide royalty. And it's time to ride and get her kingdom back.", "analysis": ""}
