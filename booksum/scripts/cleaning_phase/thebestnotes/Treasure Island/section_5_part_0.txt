{"name": "chapter 6", "summary": "On reaching Dr. Liveseys house, \nthey are informed that he has gone to the Hall with Squire Trelawney. They finally \ntrack him down, and when Dr. Livesey inquired about Captain Flint, the Squire \ntells them that he was the blood-thirstiest buccaneer that ever sailed who was \nfeared by one and all. The Captain, he said, had amassed a great deal of wealth \nthat they would require a whole ship to collect it.<PARAGRAPH>They open the oil \nskin packet that was found in the sea chest and find a book and sealed paper. \nThe book listed information found in account books with latitudes and longitudes \nand an account of the number of ships they had plundered; information gathered \nover some twenty years. This does not help them much. But the sealed paper gives \nthem valuable details about a nine-mile long island, Skeleton Island, with names \nof hills and the location of the bulk of the buried treasure.<PARAGRAPH>This suddenly \nbrings light in the eyes of the Squire and Dr. Livesey. The Squire decides to \nunearth the hidden treasure and makes his way to Bristol to get the best ship \nand crew without wasting any time. He appoints Dr. Livesey as the ships doctor \nand Jim as a cabin boy and himself, the Captain. The doctor approves Mr. Trelawneys \ndecision to accompany him on the condition that he would not tell anyone about \ntheir secret possession. He feared the men who had destroyed the Inn would be \nafter them to get the details of the treasure and should anyone know of their \nplans, they would face grave problems. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Your browser does not support the IFRAME tag.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Treasure_Island/Treasure_Island10.html"}
