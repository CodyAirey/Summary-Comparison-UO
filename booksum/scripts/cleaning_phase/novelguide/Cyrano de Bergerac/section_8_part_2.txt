De Guiche asks her whether she intends to waste her beauty living in the convent forever, guarding Christian's memory. She says that she does, and that she still keeps his last letter next to her heart. He asks her whether she forgives him for sending Christian to his death; she says that she must, since she lives in the convent. She adds that she still feels Christian's love all around her. He asks if Cyrano still visits her. She replies that he visits every week and tells her all the news. Le Bret enters and reports that Cyrano is suffering from poverty, hunger, and loneliness. De Guiche comments that Cyrano should not be pitied too much because he has lived the life he chose, free and not obligated to anyone. De Guiche adds that he himself has everything, while Cyrano has nothing, yet he would still like to shake his hand. He envies Cyrano, as it seems he can have no regrets about his life. De Guiche takes Le Bret aside and warns him that Cyrano has made enemies. De Guiche overheard one influential person saying, \"Cyrano might have an accident. Ragueneau arrives to visit Roxane. He has fallen on hard times. He gave up his shop to become a writer, but has found himself doing a series of other jobs", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210212220419/https://www.novelguide.com/cyrano-de-bergerac/summaries/act5-scenes1-6"}
