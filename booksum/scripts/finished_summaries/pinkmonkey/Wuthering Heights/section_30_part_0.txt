He finds, however, that his landlord is not at home. The visit does give Lockwood the opportunity to observe the behavior of Cathy and Hareton. Lockwood hands over to Cathy a brief note from Nelly. She reads the note eagerly and asks a few questions regarding Nelly and the Grange. Cathy confides in Lockwood that she is not allowed to have anything to read; however, she has admits she has found some religious texts in Joseph's room and some books belonging to Linton in Hareton's room. Cathy accuses Hareton of stealing these books. He says he is simply trying to learn to read. She then mocks her cousin's lack of learning. This results in a minor scuffle between them. On Heathcliff's return, Lockwood informs him of the reason for his visit. As they talk, Heathcliff admits to Lockwood that he cannot bear to look at Hareton's face, for it reminds him so much of Catherine. After a meal with his host, Lockwood returns home.", "analysis": "Notes The narrative is now again delivered by Lockwood, further unifying the end of the novel to the beginning. This chapter describes Lockwood's visit to Wuthering Heights to inform Heathcliff that he will not renew his lease at the Grange. Since his landlord is not home, Lockwood has time to observe both Hareton and Cathy, whom he calls \"a beauty. . .but not an angel.\" It is obvious to Lockwood that Hareton is fascinated with his cousin as he tries to attract her attention. Cathy, however, has no interest and is rude to the young man. When Heathcliff enters, his physical appearance is described. It is obvious that the man is ill, close to death. He admits to Lockwood that Hareton's presence is driving him crazy, for the boy is a constant reminder of his beloved Catherine."}
