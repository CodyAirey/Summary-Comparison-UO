{"name": "Act 1, Scene 1", "summary": "We find ourselves in Paris, inside the house of Orgon.<PARAGRAPH>Madame Pernelle, Orgon's dear mama, is headed out the door, and fast. She's sick of what's going on in her son's house.<PARAGRAPH>Everyone \u2013 meaning Elmire, Orgon's second wife, Damis, his son, Mariane, his daughter, and Cl\u00e9ante, his brother-in-law \u2013 try their best to get her to chill out. Nothing, however, can stop the old lady from complaining and hating on anything and everything.<PARAGRAPH>It seems that Madame Pernelle is angry because her man Tartuffe gets no respect. She thinks he's a stand-up guy and totally righteous \u2013 generally, but most especially in the religious sense. But Elmire and company think he's just self-righteous, a total fake, a thief and, as the full title of the play suggests, a hypocrite.<PARAGRAPH>Each member of the family has their own strategy for convincing Madame Pernelle: Damis just sort of gets angry, Elmire pleads, Cl\u00e9ante appeals to her reason, and Dorine, well\u2026Dorine is, as you'd expect from a French maid, pretty saucy.<PARAGRAPH>None of this works, of course. Madame Pernelle tells them they should all be grateful to have Tartuffe bossing them around and telling them how to live. As far as she's concerned, he's pretty much the ultimate life coach.<PARAGRAPH>When Cl\u00e9ante snickers at her speech, Madame Pernelle tells him to shut up, slaps Flipote, her maid, in the face, and makes her exit, followed by most of the household.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210415090456/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/tartuffe/summary/act-1-scene-1"}
