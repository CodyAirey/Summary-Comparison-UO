{"name": "Chapter 10", "summary": "Victor feels awful. Then it rains.<PARAGRAPH>He goes up to the top of Montanvert to see the views, since looking at sublime views has a way of cheering him up.<PARAGRAPH>Brain Snack: Montanvert is one of three glaciers on Mont Blanc, a big honking mountain in the Swiss Alps. In 1816, Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote a whole poem about how sublime and awesome Mont Blanc is. (Well, that's the short version. The long version has to do with the awesomeness of poets, i.e. Shelley.)<PARAGRAPH>Anyway, instead of cheering up, Victor sees the monster.<PARAGRAPH>Victor threatens to essentially kick the monster's butt, but the monster looks like The Rock.<PARAGRAPH>The monster, despite everything, invites Victor to come to a cave to talk with him by a fire. FIRE. Look out for that Prometheus reference.<PARAGRAPH>The monster talks eloquently, so Victor consents to listen to his life story. We know what you're thinking.
