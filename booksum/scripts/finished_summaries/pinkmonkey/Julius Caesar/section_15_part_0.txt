A positive Brutus, still hopeful of victory, instructs Messala to go to Cassius and tell him to lead their troops against the enemy at once. He naively believes that Octavius' soldiers are faint-hearted and that a sudden attack will quickly defeat them.", "analysis": "Notes This scene portrays an early stage of the battle when Brutus' spirits are still positive, believing that the conspirators will prevail. He sends a message to Cassius, telling him that the troops should attack at once; it is another erroneous decision."}
