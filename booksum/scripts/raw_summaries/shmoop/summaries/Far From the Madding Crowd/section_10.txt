When he asks who's asking, she says that it's his wife, Fanny Robin.<PARAGRAPH>Troy is shocked, and he tells Fanny that she can't come see him like this. She asks whether he's glad to see her, and he says of course.<PARAGRAPH>Unfortunately, he says he can't come down and meet her because he's not allowed to leave the building at this time of day.<PARAGRAPH>Fanny wants to know when Troy is going to make good on his promise to marry her. He says that they can marry as soon as they have good clothes.<PARAGRAPH>She asks why he doesn't already have permission from his officers to marry, and he admits that he simply forgot. This guy doesn't sound like the most caring fianc\u00e9 in the world. He sounds like a jerk.<PARAGRAPH>When Troy goes back inside the building, Fanny can hear a bunch of men laughing with him, probably about the fact that he has a girl waiting outside his window.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219162644/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/far-from-the-madding-crowd/summary/chapter-11"}
