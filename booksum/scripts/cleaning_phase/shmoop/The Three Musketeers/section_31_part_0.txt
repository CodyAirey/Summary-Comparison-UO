He puts his sword point at the man's throat and tells him that he spares the man's life only because of the man's sister.<PARAGRAPH>The Englishman is impressed with all of them.<PARAGRAPH>Porthos and Aramis turn their attention to the dead man, whom they undress in order to ascertain the extent of the wound.<PARAGRAPH>As they do so, a giant bag of money falls out. D'Artagnan gives it to the Lord de Winter  so that he may give it to the dead man's family.<PARAGRAPH>Lord de Winter tells him not to be ridiculous and suggests they give the purse to the Frenchmen's lackeys. He offers to introduce D'Artagnan to his sister that very evening.<PARAGRAPH>Athos asks D'Artagnan what he plans to do with the money.<PARAGRAPH>D'Artagnan replies that he was going to give it to Athos, who rightfully owns it since he killed the previous owner.<PARAGRAPH>Athos says they should give it to the lackeys--the Englishmen's lackeys.
