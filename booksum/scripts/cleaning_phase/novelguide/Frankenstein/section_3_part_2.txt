Both his professors and his fellow students marvel at how fast he is absorbing the material. Victor spends two full years doing little else but study-particularly the concept of the human body. Soon he finds it necessary to spend many hours alone at the morgue, studying corpses. After several months of this kind of work, Victor is proud to note that he has found the \"cause of generation and life. More than this, however, he's even discovered how to create life from inanimate objects. Here, Frankenstein takes great pains to persuade Walton that he is not delusional. But at the same time he admits that his thoughtless enthusiasm for scientific discovery was a tragic mistake. He implores Walton not to follow his example, warning, \"Learn from me. how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge, and how much happier that man is who believes his native town to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow. Here, Shelley seems to argue that ignorance is bliss. Victor spends the next few months continuing his painstaking attempts to create life.

Frankenstein is ecstatic at the idea that he will be the father of a new race of creatures", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200927043357/https://www.novelguide.com/frankenstein/summaries/chap3-4"}
