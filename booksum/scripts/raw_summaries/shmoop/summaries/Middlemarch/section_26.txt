{"name": "Book 3, Chapter 27", "summary": "Because of Fred's illness, Lydgate spends a lot of time at the Vincys' house, and necessarily spends most of that time with Rosamond.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Vincy is a mess \u2013 Fred was always her favorite child.<PARAGRAPH>But under Lydgate's care, Fred mends quickly.<PARAGRAPH>He continues to check on him twice a day, though, and spends evenings listening to Rosamond sing and play the piano.<PARAGRAPH>They flirt a lot, but Lydgate thinks he's safe from falling in love.<PARAGRAPH>Rosamond, meanwhile, is secretly planning her future with Lydgate.<PARAGRAPH>Not, mind, because she thinks he's rich. She knows he's not \u2013 but then, she doesn't really think about money at all.<PARAGRAPH>She knows money is necessary, but doesn't think about where it comes from. She just assumes someone will always provide it.<PARAGRAPH>One evening, Ned Plymdale, the son of a local businessman, is visiting the Vincys. He's already proposed to Rosamond once, and was rejected. He's persistent, though.<PARAGRAPH>He brought a magazine to look through with Rosamond. It's called the Keepsake, and it's pretty cheesy. (Think Hallmark cards and Lifetime movies).<PARAGRAPH>When Lydgate arrives, he plops down on the couch next to Rosamond (much to Plymdale's annoyance), and picks up the magazine.<PARAGRAPH>He glances through it, and makes fun of it for being so cheesy.<PARAGRAPH>Plymdale is displeased, and tries to defend it, but Rosamond doesn't exactly help.<PARAGRAPH>At the end of the chapter, Lydgate is called by a servant of Sir James Chettam's to attend a patient at Lowick manor. (Lowick, we know, is the Casaubons' house.)", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210307064824/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/middlemarch/summary/book-3-chapter-27"}
