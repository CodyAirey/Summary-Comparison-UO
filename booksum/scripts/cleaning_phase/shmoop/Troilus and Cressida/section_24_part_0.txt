{"name": "Act 5, Scene 10", "summary": "As Troilus tells Aeneas, Hector really is dead. Not only that, but a horse is dragging his body around the \"shameful field.\"<PARAGRAPH>Troilus prays to the gods and asks for them to \"smile at Troy.\"<PARAGRAPH>He says that when they go back home and tell Hector's family about his death, Priam will cry himself to \"stone\" and all of Troy will be devastated.<PARAGRAPH>Troilus vows to get revenge on Achilles.<PARAGRAPH>When Pandarus shows up, Troilus smacks him around and tells him to scram. He calls him a \"broker, lackey\"  and says Pandarus has to live with himself for what he's done.<PARAGRAPH>Alone on stage, Pandarus delivers a bitter speech to the audience.<PARAGRAPH>He complains about his diseased body, and how poorly he thinks he's been treated. Then he gives a shout-out to all the members of the audience involved in the sex industry.<PARAGRAPH>Brain snack: playhouses were in the same neighborhoods as brothels so it's highly likely that Pandarus's speech didn't fall on deaf ears.<PARAGRAPH>He tells us that he's dying and says he hopes there aren't any prostitutes in the audience that boo and \"hiss\" at him or the play.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, he says that when he dies , he's going to leave us all his sexually transmitted diseases in his will.<PARAGRAPH>The End.<PARAGRAPH>Yeah. We know you want more.
