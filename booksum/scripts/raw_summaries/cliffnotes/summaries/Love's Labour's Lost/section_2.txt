{"name": "Scene 1", "summary": "A formal grouping of the Princess of France with three attendant lords and three ladies takes the stage. The nobleman Boyet sings the Princess's praises (\"Yourself held precious in the worlds esteem\"), while he urges her to represent her father's interest well to \"Matchless Navarre.\" The King of France still owes 100,000 crowns to Navarre in repayment for money spent by the latter's father in the wars. As equity for the loan, Navarre keeps one part of Aquitaine. He later explains:\nIf then the King your father will restoreBut that one half which is unsatisfied,We will give up our right in Aquitaine,And hold fair friendship with his majesty. (139\u201342)\nBut before Navarre arrives on the scene, we are given an insight into the Princess's spirited character. She bids Boyet to forego his flattery:\nGood Lord Boyet, my beauty, though but mean,Needs not the painted flourish of your praise.Beauty is bought by judgment of the eye,Not utt'red by base sale of chapmen's tongues. (13\u201316)\nShe knows of Navarre's \"three year vow,\" and therefore she bids Boyet to intercede for her. At Boyet's exit, the Princess turns to her ladies and asks sarcastically about Navarre's companions.\nWho are the votaries [fellow vow-takers], my loving lords, That are vow-fellows with this virtuous duke? (37\u201338)\nIn turn, the women answer, each naming the nobleman who struck her eye when last they met: Maria remembers Longaville, \"a man of sovereign parts\" who also has \"too blunt a will\"; Katherine mentions Dumain, \"a well-accomplished youth\"; and Rosaline says that when Biron speaks, \"younger hearings are quite ravished.\" The Princess is astonished: \"God bless my ladies! Are they all in love?\"\nBoyet interrupts the talk by returning to announce that Navarre means to lodge you in the field\" rather than break his vow. The ladies don masks as Navarre, Biron, Dumain, and Longaville enter. The Princess's sharp tongue takes Navarre by surprise:\nKing: Fair Princess, welcome to the court of Navarre.Princess: \"Fair' I give you back again; and \"welcome!'I have not yet. The roof of this court is toohigh to be yours, and welcome to the widefields too base to be mine. (90\u201394)\nBiron and Rosaline echo the playfully hostile exchange of their superiors:\nBiron: What time o' day?Rosaline: The hour that fools should ask.Biron: Now fair befall your mask.Rosaline: Fair fall the face it covers!Biron: And send you many lovers!Rosaline: Amen, so you be none.Biron: Nay, then will I be gone. (122\u201328)\nDumain asks Boyet about Katherine (\"heir of Alencon\") and Longaville about Maria (\"heir of Falconbridge\") before they depart. The Princess interrupts a testy exchange between Katherine and Boyet to admonish them: \"This civil war of wits were much better used/On Navarre and his book-men, for here 'tis abused.\" The scene draws to a close with sixteen lines of rhymed couplets in which Boyet interprets Navarre's loving looks \u2014 \"all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes \u2014 as proof that the princess will most likely be able to recover Aquitaine for the price of a kiss.\nShakespeare draws the lines for his love comedy with perfect symmetry in this scene. The battle of the sexes will be a battle of wits, matching the Princess and her three ladies against Navarre and his three lords. At this juncture, Boyet functions as a go-between and commentator. Both the Princess and Rosaline speak with the verve and tough beauty of Shakespeare's heroines in such more mature plays as As You Like It and Twelfth Night. That the Princess disarms Navarre in this scene is more than possible, if Boyet can be believed. Part of the fun in the comedy derives from showing the mastermind of the \"three years' abstinence\" idea as falling in love at first sight. On stage, with a good actor, this could be made clear easily enough and would not need be broadcast to the audience. Navarre's broken lines when speaking to the Princess (\"Hear me, dear lady \u2014 I have sworn an oath\") indicate some hesitation in his speech. And the Princess describes herself as \"too sudden-bold,\" as if she noticed him being schoolboyish in his dealing with her. The King does become quite efficient when talking business (the loan, Acquitaine, etc.), but one wonders if there is more than mere formality in his words when he tells her upon parting that \"you shall deem yourself lodged in my heart.\" Any attraction Navarre does feel, of course, he would also be desperate to hide from his fellow \"votaries.\" It is perfectly obvious that each of them, in turn, is already infatuated with his female counterpart, and vice-versa. From this point on, it appears that \"love's labour\" will not really be \"lost .\nNotice the style of language in this scene. Boyet's request at the start of the scene that the Princess show herself to the best possible advantage is typically elegant:\nBe now as prodigal of all dear grace,As Nature was in making graces dearWhen she did starve the general world besideAnd prodigally gave them all to you. (9\u201312)\nThere does come a point, however, at which the rhyme used in the scene grows tedious. Even if Shakespeare meant thereby to make a comment on the character speaking, as in the following, there remains a problem for modern audiences. Boyet finishes his speech on Navarre's self-betraying looks thus:\nHis face's own margent did quote such amazesThat all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes.I'll give you Aquitaine, and all that is his,And you give him for my sake but one loving kiss. (246\u201349)\nThe Princess dismisses him: \"Come to our pavilion. Boyet is disposed.\"<PARAGRAPH>Moth sings a \"sweet air\" for Armado, then gives him advice on how to secure his love \u2014 through song, dance, face \u2014 pulling, and rhetorical devices. The conversation meanders here and there at the whim of the clever Moth, causing Armado to remark on his \"sweet smoke of rhetoric.\" Moth fetches Costard at his master's behest, and the nonsensical language games now include the newcomer. Even Costard can see that Moth is making a fool of his master, \"The boy hath sold him a bargain, a goose.\"\n\nMoth: Now will I begin your moral, and do youfollow with my l'envoy.The fox, the ape, and the humblebeeWere still at odds, being but three.Armado: Until the goose came out of door, Staying the odds by adding four.Moth: A good Fenvoy, ending in the goose. (94\u2013100)\nArmado, of course, is the \"goose\" who ends the ditty.\nCostard is twice bid to become a postman, to deliver a love letter from Armado to Jaquenetta (for which he is paid \"remuneration\"), and to deliver a note from Biron to Rosaline (for this, he gets a \"guerdon\" [reward]). Making his exit, he exclaims:\nGardon, O sweet gardon! Better than remuneration \u2014 a'levenpence farthing better. Most sweet gardon!I will do it sir, in print [with care]. Gardon!Remuneration! (171\u201374)\nTo cap the scene, Shakespeare radically shifts to a loftier style in the person of Biron, who delivers a thirty-three-line soliloquy expressing the quandary in which he finds himself. It begins: \"O, and I, forsooth, in love!\"\nThe broad contrasts which characterize the structure of Love's Labour's Lost are apparent at the beginning and the end of this scene. Armado is a braggart and a fool in love, a caricature of the transformations which can take place when a man is prey to his passions. The first moments of the scene are broadly comical, commencing as Moth sings a sweet tune to suit the master's mood (compare the opening of Twelfth Night: \"If music be the food of love, play on.\"), then going on to include a demonstration by Moth of the ways to woo a woman. Though there are no stage directions, it seems likely that Moth would at least illustrate (and perhaps coax Armado into performing) some of the physical techniques he describes: \"No, my complete master; but to jig off a tune at the tongue's end, canary to it with your feet, humour it with turning up your eyelids. . . .\" The same comical teaching takes place in a parallel scene with Toby Belch, Maria, and Andrew Aguecheek in Twelfth Night (I, 3).\nAt the other end of the spectrum, and the scene, is the nobleman Biron, also in love, wrestling with his feelings in a far more dignified manner. Love is transforming him as well:\nI, that have been love's whip,A very beadle to a humorous sigh,A critic, nay, a night-watch constable. . . .And I to be a corporal of his [Cupid's] field,And wear his colours like a tumbler's hoop!What? I love? I sue? I seek a wife! (173\u201379)\nBut there is a rightness in this change, it turns out, for the world of Shakespeare's happy comedy demands the triumph of love over artificial barriers.\nThe two love letters to be delivered by the utter, literal fool, Costard, are bound to be mixed up. Shakespeare stirs the action and excites the audience's expectation by this device. Notice, however, how relatively unimportant this sort of detail is in Love's Labour's Lost by comparison to Comedy of Errors. The life of the later comedy is less in its plot than in its language, and to a certain extent, its character.<PARAGRAPH>The Princess and her retinue are in an open park preparing for a hunt. \"But come, the bow!\" she calls, after seeing a rider in the distance and asking:\nWas the King, that spurred his horse so hard Against the steep uprising of the hill? (1\u20132)\nShe engages the Forester in conversation, displaying her intellectual superiority with puns and clever turns of phrase before rewarding him with money. After a lengthy speech on the pursuit of fame, she says,\nAnd, out of question, so it is sometimes,Glory grows guilty of detested crimes,When, for fame's sake, for praise, an outward part,We bend to that the working of the heart;As I for praise alone now seek to spillThe poor deer's blood that my heart means no ill. (30\u201335)\nand the Princess then turns her attention to Costard, who has just entered with a letter which, he says, is addressed from Monsieur Biron to Lady Rosaline. \"O, thy letter, thy letter! He's a good friend of mine,\" she exclaims boldly, requesting Boyet to read the missive at once. The letter is, in fact, from Armado to Jaquenetta, written in the most bizarre meandering style:\nShall I command thy love? I may. Shall I enforce thy love? Icould. Shall I entreat thy love? I will. What shall thouexchange for rags? Robes. For tittles? Titles. For thyself? Me.Thus, expecting thy reply, I propose my lips on thy foot, myeyes on thy picture, and my heart on thy every part. (81\u201386)\n\"What plume of feathers is that indited [wrote] this letter? asks the Princess. She tells Costard that he has misdelivered the letter, then exits with all but Boyet, Maria, Rosaline, and Costard. Boyet teases Rosaline, who responds in sharp form. It is Maria's turn next to banter with Boyet over the affair. As their speech grows more and more bawdy, Costard chimes in with an obviously obscene remark, causing Maria to say, \"Come, come, you talk greasily.\" Costard has enjoyed the chatter immensely, convinced that he and the ladies have \"put him [Armado, and perhaps Boyet] down.\" He loves the ,'most sweet jests, most incony [excellent] vulgar wit.\"", "analysis": "The display of wit is a chief resource of the characters in this play. To start the scene, the Princess aims her wit at an easy target, a Forester assisting her on the hunt. When he tells her that she is to have the \"fairest shoot,\" she coyly takes it to mean that she is the fairest one who will shoot. The Princess and her retinue surely enjoy the Forester's befuddlement: \"Pardon me, madam, for I meant not so.\" These pleasantries at the expense of a member of a lower class of society were quite normal in Shakespeare's day, as reflected in his comedies. To end the scene, another \"low' character, the rustic (or \"clown,\" as Shakespeare refers to him) Costard joins the verbal games with his betters. Boyet's suggestive language, \"And if my hand be out, then belike your hand is in,\" prompts Costard's \"Then will she get the upshoot by cleaving the pin.\" \"Pin\" refers to the male sex organ, and the talk merits a rebuke from Maria. Shakespeare contrasts the refinement of the Princess's airy allusions to Cupid and his bow at the front of the scene, to the sexual reality of romantic love here at the end. In his better plays, he manages to intermingle these two in a more interesting manner.\nThe Princess's musings on the subjects of \"fame\" and \"glory,\" quoted in the summary above, sound a central note of the play. Her philosophical bent from the first time we met her was such that she played down the importance of external beauty, or external virtues of any kind. All the while she is speaking, remember, and throughout the scene she has a hunting bow in hand (Cupid's symbol). The implicit metaphor of the bow as a means of subduing game, if not killing it, as it relates to the battle between love's demands (Cupids) and man's or woman's resistance to those demands, can be extended' to the \"battle\" between the sexes. Boyet teases the Princess, saying that women try to \"lord it over\" their lords \"for praise's sake,\" and she responds haughtily:\nOnly for praise, and praise we may afford To any lady that subdues a lord. (39\u201340)\nWhen Costard asks for \"the head lady,\" the Princess says that she is the \"thickest and tallest.\" Costard then says that it must be she, for she is the \"thickest.\" It is unlikely that he would insult her outright \u2014 \"thick\" can normally mean \"corpulent\" or \"stupid,\" or both. It is, of course, possible that some of the Princess's insistence on the irrelevance of external shape is prompted by her own slightly large frame. She does respond to Costard's words in a huff: \"What's your will, sir? What's your will?'\nThe long nonsense letter from Armado, read aloud by Boyet, allows the actor ample opportunity to lampoon the hyperbolic style of the braggart Spaniard, but in the context of the comedy as a whole, it allows for a mockery (including self-mockery) of all the courtly lovers in danger of making fools of themselves in pursuit of their partners.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201201074536/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/l/loves-labours-lost/summary-and-analysis/act-ii-scene-1"}
