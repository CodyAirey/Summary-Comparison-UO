35. THE VISIT TO BERGTHORSKNOLL

Now it was the custom between Gunnar and Njal, that each made the
other a feast, winter and winter about, for friendship's sake;
and it was Gunnar's turn to go to feast at Njal's.  So Gunnar and
Hallgerda set off for Bergthorsknoll, and when they got there
Helgi and his wife were not at home.  Njal gave Gunnar and his
wife a hearty welcome, and when they had been there a little
while, Helgi came home with Thorhalla his wife.  Then Bergthora
went up to the crossbench, and Thorhalla with her, and Bergthora
said to Hallgerda, "Thou shalt give place to this woman."

She answered, "To no one will I give place, for I will not be
driven into the corner for any one."

"I shall rule here," said Bergthora.  After that Thorhalla sat
down, and Bergthora went round the table with water to wash the
guests' hands.  Then Hallgerda took hold of Bergthora's hand, and
said, "There's not much to choose, though, between you two.  Thou
hast hangnails on every finger, and Njal is beardless."

"That's true," says Bergthora, "yet neither of us finds fault
with the other for it; but Thorwald, thy husband, was not
beardless, and yet thou plottedst his death."

Then Hallgerda said, "It stands me in little stead to have the
bravest man in Iceland if thou dost not avenge this, Gunnar!"

He sprang up and strode across away from the board, and said,
"Home I will go, and it were more seemly that thou shouldest
wrangle with those of thine own household, and not under other
men's roofs; but as for Njal, I am his debtor for much honour,
and never will I be egged on by thee like a fool."

After that they set off home.

"Mind this Bergthora," said Hallgerda, "that we shall meet
again."

Bergthora said she should not be better off for that.  Gunnar
said nothing at all, but went home to Lithend, and was there at
home all the winter.  And now the summer was running on towards
the Great Thing.
