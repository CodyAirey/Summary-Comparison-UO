In fact, when this chapter opens, he's just received news of his grandfather's death. He reacts: \"Poor Grandfather! I wish I could have got to be with him when he died\" (44.1). But he won't let it get him down.<PARAGRAPH>In fact, he isn't \"gotten down\" at all. Arthur is now \"coming into a splendid estate through the death of a very old man whom he was not fond of\" (44.2). No, Arthur isn't going to be putting this in Squire Donnithorne's obituary. In fact, he isn't thinking of Squire Donnithorne's obituary at all.<PARAGRAPH>As he rides home, Arthur's mind runs on the improvements he'll make around Hayslope, the kindnesses he'll do Mr. Irwine, and the upcoming Hetty and Adam marriage. Boy, is he in for a bubble-bursting.<PARAGRAPH>He arrives at \"dear old Hayslope at last, sleeping, on the hill, like a quiet old place as it was, in the late afternoon sunlight\" (44.8). He arrives back at his estate, where all the servants are \"assembled to receive him with a grave, decent welcome\" (44.9). Poor guy. Lost his grandfather and ruined a bunch of characters' lives.
