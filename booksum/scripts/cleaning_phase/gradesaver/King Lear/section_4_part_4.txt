{"name": "act 5, Scene ii", "summary": "Scene ii of Act V is thus an example of synedoche, representing the whole of the play by broadcasting that the battle with France plays second fiddle. Lear's battle with himself, for instance, takes precedent and points our attention to the battles of man and of the self and of good versus evil over any war-like battles which take place. This explains why the play must end in a brokenhearted atmosphere. Life's mysteries, as Lear referred to, are not meant to be won through manipulation or sword fighting.
