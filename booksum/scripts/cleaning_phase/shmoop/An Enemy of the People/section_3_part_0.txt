Billing says he's in the next room.<PARAGRAPH>The Mayor and the Doctor enter.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Stockmann whispers to her husband, reminding him not to lose his temper.<PARAGRAPH>The Mayor calls out that the meeting needs a chairman.<PARAGRAPH>The Doctor doesn't see why; he's just called the meeting to read his paper.<PARAGRAPH>Several people in the crowd call out for a chairman to be elected.<PARAGRAPH>The Mayor suggests that Aslaksen be elected chairman.<PARAGRAPH>Aslaksen accepts and urges the Doctor to proceed temperately.<PARAGRAPH>The Mayor makes a motion that the Doctor not be allowed to read his paper, as its contents could be damaging to the town.<PARAGRAPH>Dr. Stockmann is highly offended.<PARAGRAPH>The Mayor goes on to say that his own official version of events has been published in the paper, and it informs the town of all the pertinent details. The most pertinent of these is that the Doctor's improvements would mean that taxes must be raised.<PARAGRAPH>Aslaksen adds that he thinks the Doctor's real motive is to start a revolution in the town. Aslaksen says he's all for a government run by the people, just as long as it doesn't mean higher taxes.<PARAGRAPH>Everybody claps.<PARAGRAPH>Hovstad speaks. He says that he once supported Dr. Stockmann when it looked like public opinion was behind him. Now, since the public has turned against the Doctor he is no longer offering his support.

He proclaims that it could poison the entire country.<PARAGRAPH>Dr. Stockmann yells that if the whole nation is corrupted, then all its people should be destroyed.<PARAGRAPH>Hovstad cries that Stockmann is an enemy to the people.<PARAGRAPH>The unruly crowd shouts their agreement.<PARAGRAPH>Aslaksen moves that the Doctor be voted an official public enemy.<PARAGRAPH>Ballots are passed out.<PARAGRAPH>General chatter begins as the ballots are being cast.<PARAGRAPH>Kiil comes up to Dr. Stockmann.<PARAGRAPH>He asks his son-in-law if he plans to spread word that the tanneries, including the one he owns, are poisoning the water.<PARAGRAPH>Dr. Stockmann says that he must.<PARAGRAPH>Kiil tells the Doctor that exposing the tanneries is going to be an expensive decision on the Doctor's part.<PARAGRAPH>A man comes up to Captain Horster and admonishes him for hosting a public enemy in his house.<PARAGRAPH>Petra asks Captain Horster who the man was.
