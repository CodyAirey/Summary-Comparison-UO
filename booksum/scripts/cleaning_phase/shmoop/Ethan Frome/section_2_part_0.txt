Her words soothe him. He knows she wants to stay.<PARAGRAPH>They walk together quietly.<PARAGRAPH>When they hear a gunshot, and then a fox bark, Mattie snuggles up closer to Ethan and then begins to walk faster.<PARAGRAPH>He asks her if she for sure doesn't want to leave the Frome house.<PARAGRAPH>She asks him where she would possibly go if she left, and Ethan thinks she might be crying, though she denies it when he asks her.<PARAGRAPH>He feels her warm body next to his.<PARAGRAPH>They walk in though the gate of the Frome house, and passed \"the Frome grave-stones slanted at crazy angles through the snow\" .<PARAGRAPH>The gravestones seem to speak to Ethan. Taunting him they seem to say, if they couldn't escape Starkfield, how could Ethan?<PARAGRAPH>Ethan has the sudden thought that he will be stuck in Starkfield until he dies.<PARAGRAPH>He knows he has to find a way to keep Mattie with him forever, and he imagines being buried with her when they both die.<PARAGRAPH>When he has thoughts like that he feels happy.<PARAGRAPH>Mattie trips and steadies herself by yanking on Ethan's sleeve.<PARAGRAPH>He puts his arms around her for the first time.<PARAGRAPH>She doesn't try to stop him.

He imagines her fake teeth, in a cup by their bed.<PARAGRAPH>Zeena usually locks the door and leaves the key under the mat for Ethan and Mattie.<PARAGRAPH>Ethan and Mattie stop groping each other, and Ethan goes for the key.<PARAGRAPH>Alas! The key is not to be found. A bit of a panic ensues.<PARAGRAPH>Something stirs from within the house.<PARAGRAPH>The door opens.<PARAGRAPH>Zeena appears.<PARAGRAPH>She has a blanket wrapped around herself with one hand, and is holding onto a lamp with the other.<PARAGRAPH>Her face is cast in shadows.<PARAGRAPH>She looks very different to Ethan, than ever before.<PARAGRAPH>Ethan and Mattie walk into the bitterly cold kitchen.<PARAGRAPH>He asks Zeena if she forgot the key.<PARAGRAPH>She says, \"No. I just felt so mean I couldn't sleep\" <PARAGRAPH><PARAGRAPH>Mattie understands this to mean that Zeena has been feeling physically ill and rushes to her offering sympathy and help.<PARAGRAPH>Zeena refuses, and gripes at her for not stomping her boots before entering the house.<PARAGRAPH>Then she walks over to the stairs.<PARAGRAPH>Ethan wants make sure that Mattie goes up before he does.<PARAGRAPH>Otherwise, she might seem him walking into the bedroom with Zeena, and he doesn't like the idea of this.<PARAGRAPH>So, Ethan says he's going to stay down and do a little accounting work.<PARAGRAPH>Zeena says he'll get sick if he works without heat.<PARAGRAPH><PARAGRAPH>He looks at Mattie as he walks away toward the kitchen, and she looks a little afraid.<PARAGRAPH>When she's safely headed up the stairs, he agrees with Zeena about the cold, and follows her up the stairs.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210420064521/http://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/ethan-frome/summary/chapter-2"}
