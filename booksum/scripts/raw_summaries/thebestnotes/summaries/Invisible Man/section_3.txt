{"name": "chapter 3", "summary": "Black veterans from an insane asylum are walking down the road toward the Golden Day, blocking the narrator and Mr. \nNorton from passing them in the car. The insane men are mostly professionals suffering from Post Traumatic Stress \nSyndrome. The narrator tells one of the veterans that the car belongs to General Pershing in order to be allowed to pass. \nThe narrator continues to worry, for he knows the veterans are also headed to the Golden Day to find prostitutes. On such \noccasions, the bar becomes quite rowdy. The narrator leaves Mr. Norton outside and goes in to order a whiskey. The \nbartender, Big Halley, refuses to serve him any liquor to take outside. As a result, some of the veterans help bring the \nfaint Mr. Norton inside. To wake him up, someone hits him in the face and someone else pours brandy in his mouth.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Norton is surprised by the men standing around him and wants to know where he is. Halley tells a woman upstairs to \nsober up Supercargo, the bouncer, and send him down. When he appears at the top of the stairs, the veterans charge up \nafter him. The men pull him down the stairs, allowing his head to thump each step. At the bottom of the stairs, the men \nkick him and jump on him. They give him beer to wake him up and pounce on him until he is unconscious again. \nFinally, they lay his body on the bar, as if he were dead. Halley serves them drinks while the narrator searches for Mr. \nNorton, who lies unconscious again under the stairs. The narrator yells at Mr. Norton to wake up, fearing that something \nbad has happened to him. The crowd reacts by pushing him on top of the millionaire. Finally, one of the veterans steps in \nto help. The man arranges for Mr. Norton to be taken upstairs to a clean bed, where he begins to perform a medical \nexamination on him. He tells the narrator that though he is now a patient at the insane asylum, he was once a physician.<PARAGRAPH>Edna, a prostitute, and her friend enter the room where Mr. Norton has been put. She comments to her friend that she \nlikes white men because they cannot ever get enough sex. The friend says she would rather kill the whites. The veteran \nasks the two women to leave the room, fearing they will shock the fainting white man. When the veteran begins talking to \nMr. Norton about his condition, the millionaire is amazed at his knowledge and wants to hear the veteran's story. The \nveteran says he was trained as a surgeon, but was chased and beaten for trying to practice medicine in the United States.<PARAGRAPH>The conversation changes to Mr. Norton and the narrator. The veteran tells \n        Mr. Norton that the narrator is an invisible man, an automaton. The narrator \n        is extremely uncomfortable with the free and somewhat alarming conversation \n        between the crazy black man and the rich white benefactor. Mr. Norton \n        becomes equally distressed and wants to leave. As they try to depart, \n        the veteran surgeon threatens them, and the mob downstairs attacks them. \n        Halley helps them escape to the car.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025232/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Invisible_Man_Ellison/Invisible_Man_Study_Guide08.html"}
