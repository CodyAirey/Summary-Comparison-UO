She has gotten the money for Ona's mass.<PARAGRAPH>Teta Elzbieta sits next to Jurgis and pleads with him.

He thinks he's found a job at Jones's meatpacking plant pushing carts. <PARAGRAPH>Jurgis appears the next morning to start work under the foreman he spoke to the day before.<PARAGRAPH>The foreman apologizes: he's made a mistake. He can't use Jurgis.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis's friends at one of the bars explain to him that he has been blacklisted. After beating the stuffing out of a boss in the yards, does Jurgis really think anyone at the meatpacking plants will hire him again?
