The monster: Follow me; I seek the everlasting ices of the north, where you will feel the misery of the cold and frost, to which I am impassive. You will find near this place, if you follow not too tardily, a dead hare; eat and be refreshed. Come on, my enemy; we have yet to wrestle for our lives, but many hard and miserable hours must you endure until that period shall arrive.\"<PARAGRAPH>We have reached the end of Victor's narration, and the picture he has painted.
