{"name": "Chapter 40", "summary": "Beauty's world is starting to look a little bit grim. One day, another cab pulls up next to Beauty's, and the horse pulling it is \" an old worn-out chestnut, with an ill-kept coat, and bones that showed plainly through it\" . This unrecognizable horse looks at Beauty and says, \"Black Beauty, is that you?\" .<PARAGRAPH>Guess who it is? It's Beauty's old friend Ginger.<PARAGRAPH>Beauty reflects that she looks terrible, and they're able to talk for a minute. Ginger tells Beauty that she's been sold several times, but she's always moving down the ranks. At last she was bought by a man who rents out horses and cabs, who declared her worthless and has put her to work until she's \"used up\" . Oh, Ginger.<PARAGRAPH>Poor Ginger tells Beauty she wishes she were dead.<PARAGRAPH>Beauty is very upset, and puts his nose to hers, but can't think of a way to comfort her. Ginger tells him, \"You are the only friend I ever had\" , and then she drives off.<PARAGRAPH>Some time later, Beauty sees a cart with a dead horse on it and describes the terrible sight of that horse. And sadly, the horse is familiar--a chestnut horse with a thin neck and a white streak on its forehead. Beauty says, \"I believe it was Ginger; I hoped it was, for then her troubles would be over\" . If our hearts weren't broken before, they are now.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201205154804/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/black-beauty/summary/chapter-40"}
