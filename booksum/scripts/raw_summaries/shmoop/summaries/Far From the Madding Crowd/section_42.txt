{"name": "Chapter 43", "summary": "Bathsheba sits talking to her servant Liddy next to a fire. Bathsheba keeps asking questions about Fanny Robin's health when she left Weatherbury.<PARAGRAPH>It's pretty clear that she suspects that Fanny and Troy had a previous relationship and that Fanny was the woman they met on the road that day.<PARAGRAPH>Liddy mentions the rumor that there are actually two bodies inside Fanny's coffin, meaning that she has a baby inside with her. Bathsheba says this is impossible or else they would have written so on the coffin's lid.<PARAGRAPH>Bathsheba realizes that she needs to speak to someone with a strong character. So she throws on a cloak and goes to visit Gabriel Oak. She goes to his house and watches him through his windows for a while. She even watches him kneel next to his bed to pray. Once again, Thomas Hardy screams: this guy is so good.<PARAGRAPH>She soon realizes that it's too late at night for her, a married woman, to visit a bachelor alone. So she returns to her house. Once she's there, she goes to Fanny's coffin, bites the bullet, and opens it up. Inside, she sees Fanny lying dead with a baby in her arms. Bathsheba sinks to the floor and starts crying.<PARAGRAPH>Then she prays and lays some flowers around Fanny's head before closing the coffin again.<PARAGRAPH>A few moments later, she hears the house's front door opening and closing. She goes into the hallway to find her husband staring at her. He's now back from his trip.<PARAGRAPH>They stare at each other for a while before Troy asks what the matter is. Soon enough, he looks in on Fanny and the dead baby, and he falls completely silent. He finally admits to Bathsheba that Fanny was his former fianc\u00e9 and they had a baby together.<PARAGRAPH>He bends over and kisses Fanny. This fills Bathsheba with uncontrollable jealousy, and she jumps on him and demands that he kiss her to prove that he loves her more.<PARAGRAPH>Yeah, that's right: kiss her with the same lips that just kissed a corpse that had been sitting around for a few days.<PARAGRAPH>Troy, though, refuses to kiss her, admitting that he could never love her as much as he loved Fanny. He even says that in the eyes of heaven, there's no way he's married to Bathsheba.<PARAGRAPH>At this, Bathsheba can only turn and run out of the house.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219162644/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/far-from-the-madding-crowd/summary/chapter-43"}
