{"name": "Chapter VII", "summary": "Chapter VII On the following day, the storm has passed, and Martha tells Mary that spring will soon come to the moor. Martha is planning to go home to visit her family, as it is her only free day of the month. Mary asks Martha if she might someday visit her family's cottage. Martha is not certain if it will be possible, but says that she will ask her mother, who is quite clever about such things. After a pause, Mary remarks that she likes both Martha's mother and Dickon, though she has seen neither of them; she bitterly adds that she suspects that they would not like her, because no one does. Martha asks the girl if she likes herself, and Mary surprises both of them by saying, \"Not at all. After Martha sets out for home, Mary goes out into the gardens, where she finds Ben Weatherstaff in a good humor. Ben tells her that the earth itself is glad, as it has been eagerly waiting for spring. As the two stand talking, the robin appears and lights at their feet. Mary tentatively asks Ben Weatherstaff if anything is still living in the secret garden, and he replies that only the robin knows, as no one else has been inside in ten years. It occurs to Mary that she was born ten years ago, at around the same time that the garden was bolted shut. Mary wanders off, following the wall of the garden without a door. She realizes that she is fond of a number of people for the first time in her life--of Martha, and Dickon, and Martha's mother, and of the robin, whom she thinks of as a person. The robin follows her, and Mary again tries to talk to him in chirps and twitters. The bird leads her to a mound of freshly turned earth, which, when Mary examines it closely, contains a tarnished key that has long been buried. It may, Mary thinks, be the key to the secret garden", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210124225111/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/secretgarden/section5/"}
