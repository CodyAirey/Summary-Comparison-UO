{"name": "Chapter 55", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820035130/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmMiddle68.asp", "summary": "The loss of Will troubles Dorothea and she broods alone at Lowick. On a visit to Celia, Dorotheas heavy mourning dress troubles her sister. She insists on removing her widows cap and freeing her hair, to Sir James great satisfaction. Mrs. Cadwallader, who is also visiting them, takes off from a discussion on mourning to one on second marriages. This is intended to test Dorotheas reactions and to shock old Lady Chettam. Dorothea firmly snubs Mrs. Cadwalladers suggestions. Later she tells Celia she will never re-marry, but devote herself to a sort of commune where people work together in the land. Celia is not very pleased, but Sir James feels her sentiments are proper.", "analysis": "Notes Dorothea is still not aware that what she feels for Will is love. In any case, she would consider it indecent to consider a second marriage. Hence, the interference of neighbors in her life is annoying to her. Given her substantial property and independent status, she feels she would like to fulfil at least some of her ambition to be socially useful."}
