{"name": "Chapters 14-15", "summary": "At first, Jane sees little of Rochester. During their brief encounters, she notices his moodiness, but it doesn't upset her. Finally, one evening, he summons Ad\u00e8le and Jane, offering Ad\u00e8le her long-awaited present. Jane notices that Rochester is in a friendlier mood than usual, probably due to his dinner wine. Rochester enjoys Jane's frank, sincere manner, and confesses that he hasn't lived the purest, most innocent life. They discuss sin, remorse, and reformation. Finding Jane a good listener, Rochester speaks to her as freely as if he were writing his thoughts in a diary. He says he has given up his shameful lifestyle, and is ready to begin a new, pure life. Rochester tells Jane he is rearing Ad\u00e8le in order to expiate the sins of his youth.\nIn Chapter 15, Rochester tells Jane about his passion for C\u00e9line Varens, a French opera-dancer whom he naively believed loved him. One night, however, C\u00e9line arrived home with another man and they mocked Rochester's \"deformities\"; Rochester overheard the conversation and immediately ended the relationship. C\u00e9line told Rochester that Ad\u00e8le was his daughter, but he isn't sure because she doesn't look anything like him. Several years later, C\u00e9line abandoned her daughter and ran away to Italy with a musician. Although he refuses to recognize Ad\u00e8le as his daughter, Rochester took pity on the abandoned and destitute child and brought her to England.\nAt two o'clock one morning, Jane hears a demoniac laugh outside of her bedroom door and the sound of fingers brushing against the panels. She thinks it might be Pilot, Rochester's dog, wandering the hallways, but then she hears a door opening. Going into the hallway, she sees smoke billowing from Rochester's room. She rushes into his chamber and discovers the curtains on fire and his bed surrounded by tongues of flame. Unable to wake him, she deluges the bed with water. Rochester won't let Jane call for help; instead, he says that he must pay a visit to the third floor. He tells Jane that Grace Poole was the culprit and then thanks her warmly for saving his life. He asks Jane to keep the incident a secret.", "analysis": "Early critics of the novel, such as Elizabeth Rigby, objected to Rochester's character, finding him \"coarse and brutal.\" In her opinion, the novel as a whole showed an unwholesome \"coarseness of language and laxity of tone.\" The conversation between Jane and Rochester in these chapters was shocking to a Victorian audience; as Rochester himself admits, telling the story of his affair with an opera-dancer to an inexperienced girl seems odd. He justifies his action by arguing that Jane's strong character is not likely to \"take infection\" from this tale of immorality; indeed, he claims that he cannot \"blight\" Jane, but she might \"refresh\" him. Again, Rochester hopes that his relationship with Jane will bring innocence and freshness back into his life.\nJust as women need to lead active lives, Bront\u00eb argues, they should not be sheltered from life's seamier side. Not only does the Rochester's past reveal his growing faith in Jane, it also shows the Byronic side of his nature. Like Lord Byron, a romantic, passionate, and cynical poet of the early nineteenth century, Rochester let himself be ruled by his \"grande passion\" for C\u00e9line, despite its immorality. Rochester is not afraid to flout social conventions. This is also apparent in his developing relationship with Jane; rather than maintaining the proper class boundaries, Rochester makes Jane feel \"as if he were my relation rather than my master.\"\nRochester's responses to Ad\u00e8le provide insights on his past life, which help identity the reasons for his attraction to Jane. Ad\u00e8le Varens provides Rochester with a daily reminder of his past indiscretions. Attracted to luxury, to satin robes and silk stockings, Ad\u00e8le displays a materialism Rochester dislikes primarily because it reminds him of her mother, C\u00e9line Varens, who charmed the \"English gold\" out of his \"British breeches.\" Emphasizing his British innocence, Rochester's comments are ethnocentric, but they also show that he dislikes the \"artificiality\" and the materialism of women who, like C\u00e9line, are pleased with \"nothing but gold dust.\"\nRochester continues to create a contrast between C\u00e9line's superficiality and Jane's sincerity. While C\u00e9line pretended to admire his physical appearance, for example, Jane honestly tells him that she doesn't find him handsome. C\u00e9line presents an unsavory model of femininity, but also an image of unattractive foreignness. Jane's comment implies that the English, unlike their French neighbors, are deep, rather than superficial, spiritual rather than materialistic. Not only does the novel question class and gender roles, but it also develops a specific ideal of Britishness. Jane provides a prototype of the proper English woman, who is frank, sincere, and lacking in personal vanity. Rochester is intrigued by the honesty of Jane's conversation and the spirituality of her drawings, which clearly contrast with the values of the women with whom he has previously consorted. Honestly admitting that his life hasn't been admirable, Rochester is now looking for happiness, for \"sweet, fresh pleasure.\" Rochester's goal is self-transformation, a reformation to be enacted through his relationships with women.\nThe end of Chapter 15 takes a strange, almost supernatural turn. Beginning with Rochester's revelation of his illicit passion for C\u00e9line Varens, the chapter, not insignificantly, ends with an image of \"tongues of flame\" darting around his bed. Rochester's sexual indiscretions have become literalized in the vision of his burning bed, an excess that Jane douses. The scene foreshadows Jane's role in channeling Rochester's sexual profligacy into a properly domestic, reproductive passion. Jane's final dream also foreshadows the direction of her relationship with Rochester: She is \"tossed on a buoyant but unquiet sea, where billows of trouble rolled under surges of joy.\" Unable to reach the \"sweet hills\" that await her, Jane must remain for awhile in the unquiet sea. Recognizing her growing love for Rochester, Jane's unconscious warns her that their relationship will be a rocky one. Rather than letting herself be blown around by the chaos of passion and delirium, she should maintain her sense and judgment. In this novel, the bounds of reality continually expand, so that dreams and visions have as much validity as reason.\nGlossary\nRencontre a meeting.\npetit coffre a small trunk.\nMa bo\u00eete my box.\nTiens-toi tranquille, enfant; comprends-tu?
