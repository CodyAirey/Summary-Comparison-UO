{"name": "chapter 24", "summary": "Rebecca meets the old hag, Urfried, in the little tower where she is \n        imprisoned. Urfried makes the most frightening forecast for Rebecca, recounting \n        her own terrible fate at the hands of Front-de-Boeuf\u0092s father. Urfried, \n        however, had submitted to the elder Front-de-Bouef\u0092s molestation, accepting \n        the subsequent shame and dishonor. The brave Rebecca looks around for \n        some escape, but finds none. Musing over her fate, she hears footsteps \n        on the stairs. A tall man stands at the door. She offers her jewelry to \n        the man who takes off his cap and reveals himself as Bois-Guilbert. He \n        makes advances at her, which she refuses. Rebecca threatens to kill herself. \n        She would rather die than be dishonored as the old woman Urfried has been. \n        The trumpet call also saves Rebecca, for it summons Bois-Guilbert, who \n        promises to visit her again.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025232/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Ivanhoe_Sir_Walter_Scott/Ivanhoe_Study_Guide13.html"}
