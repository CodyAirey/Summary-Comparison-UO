{"name": "Book 5, Chapter 1", "summary": "The next Sunday, Chad brings Strether to see a famous artist named the Great Gloriani. It turns out that this artist likes to have big parties at his place on Sunday afternoons, and it's a pretty exclusive clique that gets to go to them. Strether is pumped.<PARAGRAPH>Strether also learns that the female duo whom Chad is attached to will be at the party. Their names are Madame and Mademoiselle de Vionnet.<PARAGRAPH>Strether is stunned by the beauty of the Great Gloriani's property (he is great, after all), and he immediately has a sense of how old, historic, and authentic it is compared to the \"new world\" (i.e. America).<PARAGRAPH>But what's even more impressive to Strether is how easily Chad gets along with this bunch of rich and famous people. The man doesn't seem to feel any anxiety at all, which is something the ever-anxious Strether envies a lot.<PARAGRAPH>Strether gets separated from Chad and runs into Bilham again. Bilham says that the artist Gloriani is always nice to all the starving, down-and-out artists living in Paris who aren't as great as he is.<PARAGRAPH>Strether admits his fear that he's boring and average compared to the people at the party, but Bilham argues that Strether is, in fact, a huge novelty to these people. As an average American, he's one of the most interesting people amongst this crowd of European aristocrats and artists. Who woulda thunk?<PARAGRAPH>After that little confidence boost, Strether asks if Madame de Vionnet and her daughter have arrived, since he's curious to get a look at them.<PARAGRAPH>Strether learns that Madame de Vionnet (the mother) is still married and her husband is alive, so he figures that Chad's attachment must be to the daughter (sweet, innocent Strether).<PARAGRAPH>Bilham more or less says that yes, Chad is in love with the daughter. But this just makes Strether wonder why the two of them aren't together. But Bilham just answers this question with a string of more question, which basically delays Strether until Miss Barrace comes over to say what's up.<PARAGRAPH>She also says she's left Miss Gostrey in the house with Waymarsh (yup, dude tagged along again).<PARAGRAPH>It turns out Miss Barrace is still totally charmed by what a cranky dude Waymarsh is. It's like she enjoys him ironically, kind of how a hipster would enjoy a moth-eaten grandpa sweater.<PARAGRAPH>Bilham and Miss Barrace suddenly express their fondness for how much everyone shows of themselves in Paris. Strether wants to know if people show themselves for who they really are, but Bilham and Barrace treat the category of \"real\" as though it isn't all that important, as long as life is entertaining.<PARAGRAPH>Strether wants to know what Miss Barrace thinks of Madame de Vionnet, but she thinks it's better if he asks de Vionnet himself. The lady herself is now at the party, and it's time for Strether to meet her. And it only took five and a half books (within the book) to get there!", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219182819/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/the-ambassadors/summary/book-5-chapter-1"}
