{"name": "Book 12", "summary": "Michael halts his narration to give Adam a breather.<PARAGRAPH>He resumes, saying that after the Flood there will be peace for a while, but eventually a guy named Nimrod will get bored and build an empire.<PARAGRAPH>He will hunt \"With war and hostile snare such as refuse/ Subjection to his empire tyrannous.\" Then, he and his followers will build a huge tower to rival Heaven.<PARAGRAPH>God will observe this and get mad; as punishment, he makes everybody associated with the tower speak different languages so they can no longer understand each other.<PARAGRAPH>Adam sees all this and is displeased; he says this Nimrod guy is nuts. God did not give man power over other men.<PARAGRAPH>Michael approves of Adam's disapproval and tells him that this is yet another result of the Fall. Man's sins ensure that he will occasionally be subjected to tyrants.<PARAGRAPH>Michael continues, saying that eventually God will get so sick of the way people are  that he will select one group of people to be his.<PARAGRAPH>This new nation will spring from a man that God named Abraham ; God will call him and promise him the land of Canaan.<PARAGRAPH>Abraham will leave everything he knows and trust in God, who eventually leads him to the Promised Land. He will have many descendants.<PARAGRAPH>Eventually, his descendants will make their way to Egypt; in a later generation, the pharaoh will get worried about their growing numbers and enslave them.<PARAGRAPH>Eventually, two brothers - Moses and Aaron - will lead them out of Egypt and back to the Promised Land.<PARAGRAPH>The pharaoh and his people will suffer immensely as a result; God will send ten plagues in order to make him release His people .<PARAGRAPH>The pharaoh will pursue his former slaves. While the freed slaves are permitted to cross the Red Sea , the pharaoh will try to cross and drown.<PARAGRAPH>Moses will act as a mediator between God and the people since God is too powerful for human apprehension.<PARAGRAPH>God will give them a bunch of laws , government, etc.<PARAGRAPH>Eventually, they will enter the Promised Land, but not for a while.<PARAGRAPH>Adam interrupts at this point, and tells Michael that now he truly sees; but, he asks Michael, why are there so many laws? Is there really that much sin in the world?<PARAGRAPH>After being settled in the Promised Land  for some time, there will be wars; God will protect them through judges and then through kings .<PARAGRAPH>The second king - a guy named David - is in the line of descent that stretches from Abraham , and ends with Jesus.<PARAGRAPH>Jesus will be the last king ever, for \"of his reign shall be no end.\"<PARAGRAPH>But that comes later; in the meantime, David's second son - Solomon - will build a massive temple to house the Ark .<PARAGRAPH>Eventually Solomon's followers will screw it up and the Israelites  will be captured and imprisoned by the Babylonians for 70 years!<PARAGRAPH>After the Babylonian Captivity, things will be OK for a while, but eventually the Israelites will fight amongst themselves and permit a stranger  to take over their kingdom.<PARAGRAPH>Adam is so happy he's crying; he tells Michael that he now understands. He asks when the big battle between Satan and Jesus will take place.<PARAGRAPH>Michael tells him it's not going to be a traditional battle.<PARAGRAPH>He tells Adam that the Son will become a man - called Jesus - and will suffer a cruel death for man's sins. He will rise from the dead after three days.<PARAGRAPH>It is \"this act\" which \"shall bruise the head of Satan, crush his strength.\"<PARAGRAPH>Jesus will hang out for a while with his disciples, and then go back to Heaven. He'll come back at some later time in the future and judge the living and the dead.<PARAGRAPH>Adam rejoices again, happy that so much good will eventually come from his mistakes. He asks Michael what will happen to the disciples.<PARAGRAPH>Michael says they will be persecuted, but that Jesus will give them courage in the form of the \"Spirit\" of God, which will comfort them.<PARAGRAPH>Michael continues, saying the future history of God's people will be complicated; bad people will pretend to be good people, and there will be more persecutions, until Jesus returns.<PARAGRAPH>Adam says he now understands everything. \"Henceforth I learn, that to obey is best,\" he says.<PARAGRAPH>Michael makes a few more remarks and then tells Adam that it's time to descend from the mountain. Adam must leave the garden soon.<PARAGRAPH>He tells him to go wake Eve; he  has given her pleasant dreams.<PARAGRAPH>Adam finds Eve already awake; she says she knows some good will come from their mistakes...eventually.<PARAGRAPH>She says to Adam, in one of the most touching moments of the poem: \"thou to me/ Art all things under Heav'n\" .<PARAGRAPH>The angels lead Adam and Eve out of the garden and down into the plain below.<PARAGRAPH>They look back at Paradise, \"so late their happy seat,\" and see a flaming sword covering the eastern side.<PARAGRAPH>They shed some tears, but wipe them. They take each other's hands, and make their way through Eden .", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210506193955/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/paradise-lost/summary/book-12"}
