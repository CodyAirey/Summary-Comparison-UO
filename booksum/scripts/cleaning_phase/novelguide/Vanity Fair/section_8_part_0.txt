{"name": "Chapter 51,52,53,54,55", "summary": "Summary - Chapters Fifty One, Fifty Two, Fifty Three, Fifty Four and Fifty Five<PARAGRAPH>In Chapter Fifty One, we are told that after being invited to Lord Steyne's parties, 'some of the very greatest and tallest doors in the metropolis' were now open to Becky. At first her success excites her, but then it begins to bore her.<PARAGRAPH>A description of a game of charades ensues and Becky impresses  the gathering when she performs the part of Clytemnestra. After a successful evening for Becky, Rawdon walks home with Mr Wenham but is stopped by bailiffs and taken away. Wenham says he does not have enough money to spare him from this action.<PARAGRAPH>Chapter Fifty Two takes the readers back to events leading up to Rawdon's arrest. With Lord Steyne's influence, little Rawdon is to be taken on at the prestigious Whitefriars boarding school. Rawdon misses him and this sentiment amuses Becky, but his sister-in-law Jane shows him kindness.<PARAGRAPH>Having been instrumental in little Rawdon's move to school, Lord Steyne determines to find out how much Briggs is still owed by Becky. He discovers the amount is  PS600 . Lord Steyne laughs at his own naivety and Becky rises further in his estimation. When he asks her about the discrepancy, she blames Rawdon and says he took the money and claimed he paid Briggs. After a discussion with the lord, Becky tells Briggs she is no longer needed as a companion and Lord Steyne has a position for her at Gauntly Hall.<PARAGRAPH>Jane and Sir Pitt Crawley think it is wrong to dismiss Briggs and suggest Rawdon chaperones Becky more closely. Sir Pitt also believes Lord Steyne visits too often and Rawdon makes sure he is present when he appears. Becky claims she prefers Rawdon's company to 'old Briggs', but when he falls asleep her face is 'haggard, weary and terrible'. It is shortly after that Rawdon is arrested by the bailiffs.<PARAGRAPH>Chapter Fifty Two continues with an explanation of where Rawdon is taken. He is being held at Mr Moss's establishment and writes to Becky the next day with instructions on how to pay his debt. The day passes, though, and her reply does not come until tea time. She is light-hearted in the note and says 'Milor' will see if he can lend her the money tomorrow. Rawdon writes to Sir Pitt and Jane, and Jane comes to his rescue. He walks home and hears laughter inside. There are no servants about and Lord Steyne and Becky are alone together upstairs. He is about to kiss her hand and she is covered in jewels.<PARAGRAPH>She tells Rawdon she is innocent and asks Lord Steyne to say the same. The lord thinks a trap has been set for him and damns her.

He adds that he has given her thousands, which he thinks Rawdon has spent, and then calls Rawdon a bully.<PARAGRAPH>Rawdon calls Lord Steyne a liar, a coward and a villain and hits him. He tells Becky to remove her jewellery and he then throws a diamond ornament at him. Rawdon demands Becky's keys to find the money that has been referred to and eventually discovers the PS1,000 bill and more in her secret desk. He says how she could have spared PS100 to release him from the bailiff. He then informs her he will pay back Briggs what is owed to her as well as some of the debts and he will send the rest back to Lord Steyne. Becky repeats she is innocent, but he leaves.<PARAGRAPH>In Chapter Fifty Four, Rawdon visits Sir Pitt and tells him his relationship with Becky is over.
