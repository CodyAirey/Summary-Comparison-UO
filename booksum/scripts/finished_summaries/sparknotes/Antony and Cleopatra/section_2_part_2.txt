{"name": "act 2, scene iv", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210126032913/https://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/antony/section3/", "summary": "Meanwhile, Lepidus orders Maecenas and Agrippa to gather their soldiers and meet at Mount Misenum, where they shall confront Pompey's army", "analysis": "Act II, scenes iii-vi Although the contradictory impressions we are given of the major characters may be confusing, they allow us to gain a more complex understanding of each character by seeing him or her from a variety of viewpoints. For example, in the opening scenes of the play, Demetrius and Philo complain that their general has sacrificed his better self for the sake of a gypsy's lust. Three scenes later, Caesar describes Antony's incomparable prowess in battle, confirming the audience's impression of the general's military might. When Antony appears in Act II, scene iii, however, he seems less interested in maintaining this heroic reputation than in pursuing his own pleasure. We may find it difficult to decide whether the Antony we see is the celebrated war hero or a man corrupted by his desires for fame and romance. The play does not offer simple answers to such questions, because it declines to privilege one point of view over another. Throughout, we must balance Caesar's impressions with Enobarbus's in order to reconcile Cleopatra's understanding of Antony with Antony's understanding of himself. Antony, like each character in the play, is the product of three distinct elements: what other characters think of him, what he thinks of himself, and what he does. Although in other plays Shakespeare often limits the number of lenses through which the audience views his characters, he refrains from doing so in Antony and Cleopatra. Antony is not simply a hero, nor is he simply a fool who has thrown away reason and duty for love. An accurate picture of his character must incorporate both of these traits. Similarly, Cleopatra is both the regal, incomparably beautiful seductress of Enobarbus's speech and the spoiled, petty tyrant who beats her servant for delivering unwelcome news. More than any other character in the play--and perhaps in all of Shakespeare--Cleopatra assumes each of these contradictory roles with unmatched passion and flair. She is, above all else, a consummate actress, a woman whose grief over Antony's marriage to Octavia can be soothed only by the theatrics of drawing a knife on her innocent messenger. Cleopatra's over-the-top behavior may cause us to doubt the authenticity of her emotions and question whether her grief is more performance than actual feeling. But to entertain such doubts about her may be to look at the play too much from the Roman point of view. We should remember that Cleopatra is more than the harlot the Romans see when they look at her. As Enobarbus says in Act II, scene ii, Cleopatra is a woman of \"infinite variety\": there is room in her for both theatrical emotions and genuine love, for both stately grandeur and for girlish insecurity . The Roman characters repeatedly remark that Cleopatra's beauty is sufficient to undo otherwise indestructible men. In general, Antony and Cleopatra exhibits a great deal of anxiety about the power of women over men. The Romans constantly chastise Cleopatra for her ability to topple Antony's sense of reason and duty, while they expect Octavia to quell the animosity between Antony and Caesar by serving to \"knit  hearts / With an unslipping knot\" . Notably, both the blame for men's downfalls and the hope for their recovery are burdens placed on women."}
