{"name": "Chapter 13", "summary": "Scott claims that the epigraph from this chapter comes from Homer's Iliad, but we find these lines in Book V of the Epigoniad, by a Scottish poet named William Wilkie (1721-1772). The lines describe an archery contest \u2013 so guess what this chapter is going to be about?<PARAGRAPH>Now that Ivanhoe is back, Prince John sees trouble coming his way.<PARAGRAPH>After Ivanhoe's departure to the Holy Land with King Richard, Prince John gave Ivanhoe's castle to his own favorite, Reginald Front-de-Boeuf. Will Front-de-Boeuf have to return his property now?<PARAGRAPH>Prince John has also noticed Rowena's distress at Ivanhoe's unexpected return.<PARAGRAPH>He thinks it only proper that a beautiful Saxon like her, with many rich lands to her name, should marry a Norman knight of his choosing.<PARAGRAPH>Prince John decides that Rowena should marry his good buddy de Bracy.<PARAGRAPH>De Bracy adds that he will happily marry anyone with lands that he likes.<PARAGRAPH>Prince John orders that Cedric and Athelstane attend his banquet that night.<PARAGRAPH>A messenger brings Prince John a letter written and sealed by Philip II of France. It says: \"Take heed to yourself, for the Devil is unchained!\" (13.20).<PARAGRAPH>Prince John and his advisors realize that this means King Richard has been set free. He is probably on his way back to England right now!<PARAGRAPH>The time has come for Prince John to make his uprising official.<PARAGRAPH>But first, the Normans have to finish off the tournament so the common people won't be unhappy.<PARAGRAPH>Prince John starts the archery contest.<PARAGRAPH>The competitors are down to eight when Prince John spots that yeoman who insulted the Normans in Chapter 7.<PARAGRAPH>The yeoman tells Prince John his name: Locksley.<PARAGRAPH>Prince John challenges Locksley to participate in the archery contest. If Locksley loses, he'll be whipped. If he wins, he'll get the prize money plus an extra twenty gold pieces.<PARAGRAPH>For now the winner of the archery tournament is Hubert, a ranger who works for Philip de Malvoisin.<PARAGRAPH>Locksley agrees to shoot at Hubert's target if Hubert will then agree to shoot at a target of Locksley's choosing.<PARAGRAPH>Locksley wins, of course.<PARAGRAPH>Then Locksley cuts a willow rod and stands it at one end of the tournament field. He challenges Hubert to hit that rod.<PARAGRAPH>Hubert is certain that he cannot.<PARAGRAPH>Locksley splits the willow rod with his arrow, and everyone applauds his skill as an archer.<PARAGRAPH>Prince John hands Locksley his prize money and offers Locksley a job.<PARAGRAPH>Locksley refuses. He wants to work for King Richard.<PARAGRAPH>Locksley also gives the twenty gold coins in prize money to Hubert and then disappears.<PARAGRAPH>Prince John lets him go because he has other things to worry about. He sends one of his men after Isaac of York.<PARAGRAPH>He demands two thousand crowns (a lot of money), or else he is going to cut Isaac's head off.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210614173333/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/ivanhoe/summary/chapter-13"}
