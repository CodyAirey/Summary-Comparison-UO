{"name": "Chapter 22", "summary": "Just then, Hester hears military music floating down the street.<PARAGRAPH>The magistrates and citizens are arriving at the meetinghouse to hear the Reverend Dimmesdale's Election Sunday sermon.<PARAGRAPH>First comes the music, then the men of \"civil eminence\" , and then the \"young and eminently distinguished divine\" .<PARAGRAPH>Dimmesdale is looking pretty energetic, but he doesn't even bother glancing at Hester, who's pretty bummed out.<PARAGRAPH>It's almost like he's a different person from the guy who kissed her in the forest--which is exactly what Pearl points out.<PARAGRAPH>Someone else notices the change, too. It's Mistress Hibbins, the town witch, given a wide berth by everyone else in the town.<PARAGRAPH>She stands next to Hester Prynne, and the whole town starts sweating in fear.<PARAGRAPH>You never want your adulteress and your witch to start plotting together, after all.<PARAGRAPH>Anyway, Mistress Hibbins tells Hester that she knows something's up. When the Black Man sees one of his servants fail to acknowledge his allegiance publicly by wearing a mark like Hester's scarlet A, he makes sure to shame that person by placing a mark on his body and revealing it to the world.<PARAGRAPH>What?<PARAGRAPH>Translated: Dimmesdale may not wear a scarlet letter on his clothes, but he's wearing one on his body.<PARAGRAPH>As Hester listens to Dimmesdale's sermon, she feels worse than ever.<PARAGRAPH>For some reason, Pearl gets to play in the marketplace, watched by a group of American Indians.<PARAGRAPH>The shipmaster gets her attention by throwing her a gold chain, which she twists around her neck and waist.<PARAGRAPH>Hm, a little foreshadowing, perhaps?<PARAGRAPH>He gives her a message to take to Hester: Chillingworth is going to bring Dimmesdale on board with him, so she doesn't need to worry about him.<PARAGRAPH>Oh, and also calls her \"witch-baby,\" but Pearl doesn't go for that: Mistress Hibbins says her father is the \"Prince of the Air.\"<PARAGRAPH>Hester is seriously bummed out now, since apparently they're never going to escape Dimmesdale.<PARAGRAPH>Also, there are a bunch of strangers in town, and they're all staring at her letter, since their mommas didn't teach them any manners.<PARAGRAPH>The sailors and American Indians are also  gawking.<PARAGRAPH>With all these people staring at Hester's chest, the townspeople are feeling pretty interested, too.<PARAGRAPH>And this is all going down while Dimmesdale is standing up on his pulpit.<PARAGRAPH>Who, says the narrator, could have guess that the scarlet letter marked them both, the sinner and the  saint?", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20211014221130/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/scarlet-letter/summary/chapter-22"}
