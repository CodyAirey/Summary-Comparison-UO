Sweet! Now he can write her letters demanding sex. Mrs. Flint realizes that something's up and isn't too happy about it. She argues with Dr. Flint. A lot. Dr. Flint ups the intrigue by insisting that his four-year-old daughter sleep in his room at night. How is this going to help him get Linda into his bed? Well, obvs she has to sleep in there, too, since it's not like he's going to get up at night to tend to the little girl. Mrs. Flint finally asks Linda straight out if there's anything hinky going on with her and the Dr. Linda spills about everything--the harassment, the demands, the creepy letters--and Mrs. Flint makes her sleep in a room nearby so she can keep an eye on things. This doesn't really make her any less jealous, though, and Linda is a little worried that Mrs. Flint is going to snap one day and kill her. By the way? Dr. Flint has eleven children with slave women, but no one thinks it's a big deal. Everyone does it. It's a win-win for the masters: sex and, if you're lucky, a new little piece of property as a bonus. Ew. So much ew.", "analysis": ""}
