It is a magnificent building, and Hygelac's wife, Hygd, is an ideal queen.<PARAGRAPH>The poet contrasts Hygd, who does what is expected of her, with the story of Queen Modthryrh, who was her opposite.

He has nothing but praise for the hospitality of Hrothgar and his queen. He also mentions Freawaru, Hrothgar's daughter, and her proposed marriage to Ingeld, of the house of Heathobard. The marriage is to pay for the Danes' killing of a prince in a feud, but Beowulf fears that there may still be bloodshed over the matter. He imagines what will happen when the Danes attend the wedding, wearing the spoils they looted after the battle in which the Heathobards were defeated.

But this judgment is now reversed.<PARAGRAPH>Hygelac presents Beowulf with a sword and a large amount of land.<PARAGRAPH>The way of life at the court of King Hygelac of the Geats is largely the same that of Hrothgar's Danes. It is the same warrior code, the safe haven of the mead-hall, with the obligations of gift-giving placed on the king; also the loyalty of the warrior to hand over his treasure to the king. the same outbreak of feuds and their violent settlement.<PARAGRAPH>Just as in earlier passages, Heremod was contrasted with Beowulf, this section presents another pairing.
