{"name": "Chapter 1: The Piazza", "summary": "The narrator quotes from Shakespeare's Cymbeline. There's a lot of quoting in this story.<PARAGRAPH>Narrator says he's moved out to the country, to a house without a piazza, or porch.<PARAGRAPH>The lack of a piazza makes him sad.<PARAGRAPH>Yes, that's an important plot point. The house has no porch--conflict!<PARAGRAPH>This is not a two-fisted, pulse-pounding tale, in case you couldn't tell already.<PARAGRAPH>The house is old; it's got a big elm tree by it.<PARAGRAPH>You can also see Mount Greylock from the house, the highest peak in Massachusetts, <PARAGRAPH>The narrator compares Greylock to the ancient King Charlemagne, because that's the sort of labored, cutesy narrator you've got here.<PARAGRAPH>Three paragraphs in, Shmoop doesn't know the narrator's name, but still, Shmoop would like to never know his name and never hear from him again.<PARAGRAPH>Narrator decides to build a piazza. He wonders which side of the house to put it on. He hems and haws, but eventually decides on the north, so he can see Mount Greylock.<PARAGRAPH>Folks laugh at the narrator for building a porch to the north, since that isn't usually where you put a porch. But the narrator is unconventional. Good for him.<PARAGRAPH>Sitting on his porch reminds him of the sea, because Melville went to sea, and is famous for his sea tales. So this bit is kind of a branding exercise; he's letting readers know that they haven't wandered into the wrong restaurant.<PARAGRAPH>At some point in his sitting on the porch, he spies a spot that interests him.<PARAGRAPH>He tries looking at it over a year or so, but can never really pin it down.<PARAGRAPH>What could it be? He's reading Midsummer's Night Dream, so it must be something fanciful and filled with fairy dust.<PARAGRAPH>Fairy dust...ah...ah...choooo!<PARAGRAPH>Excuse Shmoop.<PARAGRAPH>The narrator is somewhat ill too, it sounds like. Not clear if he's sneezing though.<PARAGRAPH>But despite illness he decides to set off for fairy land.<PARAGRAPH>He fights Harry Potter in a duel to the death.<PARAGRAPH>No, not really.<PARAGRAPH>But somehow or other he gets to a pasture, and comes to a house.<PARAGRAPH>He finds a girl named Marianna sewing at a window.<PARAGRAPH>She lives with her brother, who is out most of the day, and so she is very lonely.<PARAGRAPH>She can see the narrator's house from her window, and thinks whoever lives there must be happy.<PARAGRAPH>That's irony, folks, because the narrator is melancholy too.<PARAGRAPH>They talk about a passing cloud. Then they talk about the cloud some more. Not much happening in a story when you need to spend a page talking about a cloud.<PARAGRAPH>The cloud's shadow looks like a dog. True story.<PARAGRAPH>More talk about clouds, more Marianna being sad and lonely.<PARAGRAPH>She wishes she could see whoever it is who lives in the house.<PARAGRAPH>The narrator tells her he wishes he were the inhabitant of that happy house.<PARAGRAPH>But then he's back at his piazza, and you realize the whole conversation with Marianns was a vain fancy.<PARAGRAPH>Some people imagine unicorns and flying and explosions and exciting things when they daydream. The narrator just imagines some lonely person far off who watches clouds.<PARAGRAPH>She haunts him with her unreal reality.<PARAGRAPH>That's it. Yes, it's a whole story about sitting on a porch looking out while imagining someone else sitting by a window looking at you. And ocassionally talking about clouds.<PARAGRAPH>The next story's better, Shmoop promises.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201207031456/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/the-piazza-tales/summary/chapter-1-the-piazza"}
