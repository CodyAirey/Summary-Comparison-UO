{"name": "Chapter 11", "summary": "Beauty begins to realize how fantastic Birtwick really is: \"Our master and mistress were respected and beloved by all who knew them\" . More than this, though, they're exceptionally kind to animals, and have campaigned to get rid of bearing reins in their immediate area.<PARAGRAPH>Beauty recalls a time his master was riding him home when they came across a man driving a cart with a bay pony. The man is whipping the pony roughly, and Beauty's master immediately stops and addresses the man.<PARAGRAPH>The man, Sawyer, argues with Squire Gordon, who asks him, \"Do you think  that treatment like this will make him fond of your will?\" . His lecture hits a near-preachy crescendo when he says, \"Remember, we shall all have to be judged according to our works, whether they be toward man or toward beast\" .<PARAGRAPH>Beauty mentions another similar event: They come across Captain Langley, a friend of Squire Gordon's, and see that Langley is driving a pair of grey horses with bearing reins. Uh-oh... Squire Gordon appeals to Langley's military past, asking him if his men could perform a drill with \"their heads tied to a backboard!\" . Another passionate rant about the evil of fashion and how this practice physically hurts horses ensues, until Captain Langley agrees to think about it. Good call, Captain.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201205154804/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/black-beauty/summary/chapter-11"}
