This leaves King John free to have a private chat with Hubert.<PARAGRAPH>King John starts off by telling Hubert that he owes him one. Hubert says, \"Hey, no problem.\"<PARAGRAPH>Then King John starts acting weird. He says he wants to say something to Hubert, but he can't, because the time isn't right. If it were a dark, gloomy night, and they were standing in a graveyard, then the atmosphere would be right.<PARAGRAPH><PARAGRAPH>Hubert is all, \"You can trust me, King John. I'm your loyal subject.\"<PARAGRAPH>King John says something like \"You see that little brat over there? He's like a little snake that's always in my way. You know what I'm sayin', Hubert?
