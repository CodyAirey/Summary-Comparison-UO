{"name": "Chapter XXXII", "summary": "Chapter XXXII. The victorious outlaws assemble in the forest to divide up the spoils they plundered from the burning castle. Cedric is distraught because Athelstane was killed. He pardons Gurth, makes him a free man and gives him some land. Rowena arrives with an escort. De Bracy, now a prisoner, asks her to forgive him, but Rowena is reluctant to forgive him for all the misery his passion for her has caused. The Black Knight tells Cedric he will soon ask a boon from him, and Cedric says it is granted already, because he is so grateful for the Black Knight's assistance. The Black Knight then frees De Bracy, who grabs a horse and rides away. Locksley gives the Black Knight a bugle and tells him to blow three notes on it if he should ever need assistance in the forest. Locksley then distributes the booty in a fair manner. One-tenth is to be given to the church; some goes to the families of the dead, and some is given to the outlaws according to their rank and merit. Locksley's decisions in the matter are accepted by all. Friar Tuck arrives belatedly, with Isaac in tow. The Friar claims that Isaac has converted to Christianity, but Isaac vehemently denies it. The Friar aims a blow at Isaac, but the Black Knight restrains him. The Friar and the Black Knight then exchange blows in a test of strength, which the Black Knight wins. Another prisoner is then brought to Locksley. This is Prior Aymer of Jorvaulx", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210304062321/https://www.novelguide.com/ivanhoe/summaries/chapter32-35"}
