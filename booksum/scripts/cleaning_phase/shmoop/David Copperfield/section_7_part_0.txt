{"name": "Chapter 8", "summary": "David makes his way to an inn in London, where he catches the mail coach heading for Suffolk.<PARAGRAPH>Eventually, he finds himself back on Mr. Barkis's coach.<PARAGRAPH>David assures Mr. Barkis that he has passed on the message - \"Barkis is willing\" - to Peggotty.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Barkis replies that, anyway, nothing came of it. Peggotty never answered him. And he's not willing to go speak to Peggotty directly about the matter.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Barkis discovers that Peggotty's first name is not Peggotty, it's Clara <PARAGRAPH>Mr. Barkis suggests that David tell Peggotty that he, Mr. Barkis, is waiting for an answer.<PARAGRAPH>David finds it very strange to be going home, where he remembers happy times with his mother and Peggotty that will never come again.<PARAGRAPH>David comes in to his old house and hears the sound of his mother singing.<PARAGRAPH>David enters the parlor to find his mother breast-feeding a baby: it is her new son.<PARAGRAPH>In that moment, David is as perfectly happy and good as he has ever been.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Copperfield embraces David, Peggotty comes running in, and everyone is overjoyed.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. and Miss Murdstone have gone out, so they have the house to themselves.<PARAGRAPH>They all dine together, and David tells Peggotty about Mr. Barkis's message.<PARAGRAPH>Peggotty laughs and throws her apron over her face.<PARAGRAPH>Peggotty tells Mrs. Copperfield that Barkis wants to marry her.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Copperfield says it would be a good match, but Peggotty says she won't do it.<PARAGRAPH>David notices that Mrs. Copperfield is looking thin, anxious, and tired.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, Mrs. Copperfield reaches out to Peggotty and asks her not to leave Mrs. Copperfield. She says ominously: \"Don't leave me, Peggotty. Stay with me. It will not be for long, perhaps\" <PARAGRAPH>Peggotty promises that she will never leave Mrs. Copperfield, even though some might be pleased if she did.<PARAGRAPH>David tells them about how awful Mr. Creakle is, and how good Steerforth is.<PARAGRAPH>They are so happy and peaceful together that David can imagine the Murdstones had never come in to their lives.<PARAGRAPH>Suddenly, Peggotty wonders whatever became of David's great-aunt .<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Copperfield tells Peggotty to put it out of her mind; it's not like they're likely to see Miss Betsey again .<PARAGRAPH>Peggotty thinks that Miss Betsey might leave David something in her will if she were to die. Miss Betsey might be willing to forgive David for being born a boy now that he's got a brother.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Copperfield begins  to cry. She tells Peggotty that she is being jealous and should go off and marry Mr. Barkis after all.<PARAGRAPH>Peggotty answers that it would make Miss Murdstone happy if she did.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Copperfield scolds Peggotty for her bad nature.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Copperfield accuses Peggotty of insinuating that neither Miss nor Mr. Murdstone have good intentions.<PARAGRAPH>Peggotty doesn't answer.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, Mrs. Copperfield winds down and suggests that she and Peggotty shouldn't argue anyway, because Peggotty is Mrs. Copperfield's true friend.<PARAGRAPH>Peggotty is quick to agree to this, and everyone seems happy again.<PARAGRAPH>At around 10 o'clock, they hear coach wheels: the Murdstones are back.<PARAGRAPH>David rushes off to bed before he can meet them.<PARAGRAPH>The next morning, David creeps into the parlor. He sees Mr. Murdstone and apologizes for having bitten him all that long time ago.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Murdstone thanks David for his apology and shakes his hand - with the hand that David bit.<PARAGRAPH>David greets Miss Murdstone, whose only reply is that she's glad that a day of David's holiday has already passed .<PARAGRAPH>One day, David comes into a room where Miss Murdstone and Mrs. Copperfield are sitting with the baby.<PARAGRAPH>David picks up his brother, and Miss Murdstone gives a scream.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Murdstone has a huge fit because David has touched the baby. She insists that David can never be allowed to touch the baby again.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Copperfield weakly agrees with Miss Murdstone's order.<PARAGRAPH>On a later occasion, Mrs. Copperfield notices that the baby has the exact same eyes as David. She decides that their blue eyes must come from her side of the family.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Murdstone takes huge offense at this, calls Mrs. Copperfield a fool, and insists that David and his brother are completely and totally different in all ways.<PARAGRAPH>David continues to feel ashamed and excluded by everyone at the Rookery: those who like him are afraid to show it, and those who don't like him tell him so over and over again to his face.<PARAGRAPH>Because they don't like him and he seems to make them unhappy, David decides to keep as quiet and out of the way as he can.<PARAGRAPH>But he can't stay totally out of the way: the Murdstones make David sit with the family in the parlor in the evenings so that they can monitor Mrs. Copperfield's treatment of him.<PARAGRAPH>One evening, the two Murdstones comment that David has a sulky, sullen manner.<PARAGRAPH>For once, Mrs. Copperfield doesn't just go along with their bullying: she asks Miss Murdstone if she is sure that she understands David.<PARAGRAPH>But Miss Murdstone immediately shames Mrs. Copperfield into agreeing, again, as usual.<PARAGRAPH>And then the two Murdstones humiliate her further by calling into question her judgment: Mr. Murdstone calls Mrs. Copperfield \"weak and inconsiderate\" .<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Murdstone turns on David again.<PARAGRAPH>David says he hasn't meant to be sulky, and Mr. Murdstone calls him a liar with an attachment to \"low and common company\"  - in other words, servants like Peggotty. He forbids David from hiding away in his room or in the kitchen any longer.<PARAGRAPH>So, David has to spend all of his time in the parlor trying to avoid being yelled at.<PARAGRAPH>And so his holidays pass away.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, David gets to go back to school. He's sorry to leave his mother and baby brother, but still he's glad to be getting away from the Rookery.<PARAGRAPH>As David drives away with Mr. Barkis, he hears his mother calling.<PARAGRAPH>He looks over his shoulder and sees her looking at him care with her eyes, holding his baby brother up for him to see.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200929182814/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/david-copperfield/summary/chapter-8"}
