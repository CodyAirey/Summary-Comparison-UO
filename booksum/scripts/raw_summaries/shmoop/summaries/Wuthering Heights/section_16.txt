One night, Hindley locks Heathcliff out of the house and shows Isabella his gun again, resolving to murder Heathcliff. Isabella shouts out a warning to Heathcliff. Heathcliff bursts into the house and beats the living daylights out of Hindley. The next morning he looks a mess.

He hurls a knife at her.<PARAGRAPH>Isabella ends her visit with Nelly and leaves the Grange, never to return.<PARAGRAPH>Nelly describes Edgar's mourning after Catherine's death and the deep affection he develops for baby Catherine, whom he calls Cathy\u2014a nickname he never used with his wife.<PARAGRAPH>Six months after Catherine's death, Hindley finally dies too.
