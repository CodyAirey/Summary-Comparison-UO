The woman's steps are feeble and she has a lot of trouble walking. She finally collapses and wakes up hours later in the middle of the night.<PARAGRAPH>She knows that she still has miles to go until she reaches Casterbridge.<PARAGRAPH>Eventually, she can't go any further and falls again. This time, though, a wandering dog comes over and licks her face until she starts moving again.<PARAGRAPH>By some miracle of strength, she eventually reaches the Casterbridge shelter. There are people there to greet her, and she collapses in their arms.<PARAGRAPH>Before she passes out, she asks about the dog that helped her along the road. The man from the shelter tells her that he threw rocks at the dog until it went away. How's that for thankfulness?", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219162644/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/far-from-the-madding-crowd/summary/chapter-40"}
