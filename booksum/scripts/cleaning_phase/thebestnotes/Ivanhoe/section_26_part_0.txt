{"name": "chapter 43", "summary": "Rebecca's trial attracts a large crowd, including many of Robin Hood's \n        men. Just as her situation seems hopeless, for no champion has offered \n        to defend Rebecca, Ivanhoe rides into the arena. He challenges those who \n        accuse the beautiful Jewess. Brian de Bois-Guilbert becomes an unwilling \n        participant in the fight as a representative of the people who accuse \n        Rebecca; Beaumanoir and the Knight Templars demand his obedience and loyalty. \n        It is an exciting and hard-fought battle, but Bois-Guilbert is finally \n        killed. Ivanhoe has saved Rebecca.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025232/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Ivanhoe_Sir_Walter_Scott/Ivanhoe_Study_Guide17.html"}
