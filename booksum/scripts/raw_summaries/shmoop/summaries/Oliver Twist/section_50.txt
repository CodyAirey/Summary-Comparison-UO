{"name": "Chapter 51", "summary": "Two days later, Oliver, Mrs. Maylie, Rose, Mrs. Bedwin, Mr. Losberne are traveling to Oliver\u2019s native town (Mudfog, if you\u2019re reading an edition that names the town). Mr. Brownlow and some nameless additional person are following in a separate carriage.<PARAGRAPH>Oliver, Rose, and Mrs. Maylie have been told about what Monks admitted (that Oliver is, in fact, his younger half brother, and that he and his mother had conspired to keep him from his inheritance \u2014all that good stuff).<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Brownlow decided that the delicate and innocent ears of Oliver, Rose, and Mrs. Maylie shouldn\u2019t hear about what happened to Sikes.<PARAGRAPH>Oliver is especially excited to see his dear old friend Dick again (remember the little orphan at Mrs. Mann\u2019s baby farm who blessed him when Oliver ran away from home?), and Rose promises him that they\u2019ll take Dick away from the parish authorities and take care of him.<PARAGRAPH>Everything in the town is very much as Oliver remembered it, only maybe it seems smaller and less intimidating now.<PARAGRAPH>They arrive at the hotel in Mudfog, and Mr. Grimwig is there to meet them.<PARAGRAPH>All the men, and occasionally Mrs. Maylie, as well, are bustling around looking anxious and dealing with \"business,\" and Rose and Oliver are kept in the dark.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, the men all enter the room where Oliver and Rose have been waiting, and bring with them the man who had appeared at Oliver\u2019s window with Fagin\u2014Monks!<PARAGRAPH>Monks looks hatefully at Oliver.<PARAGRAPH>They introduce Oliver to Monks as his half brother, the illegitimate son of Edward Leeford, Mr. Brownlow\u2019s oldest friend, and Agnes Fleming, who died in childbirth way back in the very first chapter.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Brownlow asks Monks to explain the circumstances of Oliver\u2019s birth to the assembled group, even though it\u2019s already been written down and signed by Monks in his \"confession.\"<PARAGRAPH>Monks tells the story of what happened when he and his mother arrived in Rome to meet his dying father:<PARAGRAPH>His father was in the last stages of his illness, and was so feverish he didn\u2019t know they were there.<PARAGRAPH>He and his mother found two papers on his desk that were supposed to have been forwarded to Mr. Brownlow\u2014one was a letter, and the other was his will.<PARAGRAPH>The letter was addressed to Agnes, begging her forgiveness (he had, after all, knocked her up without marrying her\u2014a big no-no), and asking her to take care of the child and not to blame the innocent baby for any of its father\u2019s sins.<PARAGRAPH>The will described how evil his first wife was, and how wicked and malicious his first son (Monks) was, and how he wanted his property to be divided into two portions: the first to go to Agnes Fleming, and the second portion to go to their as-yet-unborn child\u2014but only if he reached adulthood without having committed any public act of dishonor. If the child did commit any such act, then that portion of his estate would go to Monks, because the two children would then be equal.<PARAGRAPH>Monks\u2019s mother had burnt the will\u2014Monks says that was the only sensible thing to have done. And the letter his father had written never reached Agnes.<PARAGRAPH>Monks\u2019s mother then told Agnes Fleming\u2019s father everything about it, but colored it all so terribly as to make Edward Leeford sound like a total jerk.<PARAGRAPH>So Agnes\u2019s father had run away from his village in shame with his other daughter, and had even changed his name.<PARAGRAPH>Agnes herself, meanwhile, had already run away (she was preggers and unmarried and didn\u2019t want to dishonor her father or younger sister).<PARAGRAPH>Her father had tried to find her, but decided that she must have committed suicide, so he retreated to some obscure corner of Wales and died of a broken heart.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Brownlow picks up the story from there: some years later, Monks\u2019s mother had gone to Mr. Brownlow\u2014she told him that Monks had run away from her when he was eighteen years old, and had robbed her of jewels and money on his way out. She had an incurable disease, and wanted to see him before she died.<PARAGRAPH>Brownlow helped her, and they did find Monks, and he went back with his mother to France.<PARAGRAPH>Monks continues the story from there: his mother died, but before she died she told him about how Agnes Fleming\u2019s father had died in Wales, and that she had a hunch that Agnes had not killed herself, as her father was led to believe, but had lived long enough to have had a son. Monks swore to his mother on her deathbed that he would hunt down that child, drag it into crime, and see it hanged.<PARAGRAPH>Monks works himself into a bit of a passion at the very thought of getting his little brother hanged, so Mr. Brownlow has to take over the story from there:<PARAGRAPH>Fagin was an old acquaintance (and accomplice) of Monks, and had received a large reward for corrupting Oliver, but had to give up a portion of it if Oliver were ever rescued. That was why they\u2019d both appeared at the country house\u2014Fagin wanted to see if it was really Oliver.<PARAGRAPH>Monks is able to pick up the story again at this point: he bought the locket and the ring from the \"man and woman\" he had told them about before, who had stolen them from old Sally, who had stolen them from Agnes\u2019s dead body.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Grimwig takes this signal to bring in the Bumbles.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Bumble comes in full of fake enthusiasm at seeing Oliver again.<PARAGRAPH>They tell him to shut it, and ask him to identify Mr. Monks.<PARAGRAPH>The Bumbles pretend never to have seen him before, and deny any knowledge of the locket or the ring.<PARAGRAPH>But then the two old pauper women who were with old Sally the night she died are brought in\u2014they were listening at the door when Sally told Mrs. Bumble about the locket and the ring, and they spied on Mrs. Bumble when she went to the pawnbroker\u2019s shop to pick them up.<PARAGRAPH>At that point, Mrs. Bumble realizes that she\u2019s in a corner, and admits it, but in a not-very-nice way. She asks what they\u2019re going to do about it.<PARAGRAPH>They say nothing, but they\u2019re going to make sure she\u2019s never in a position of trust or authority again.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Bumble tries to get himself off the hook by saying it was all Mrs. Bumble\u2019s fault, but Mr. Brownlow points out that in the eyes of the law, Mrs. Bumble, as the wife, always acts under Mr. Bumble\u2019s direction.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Bumble says that if the law thinks that he can direct his wife, then the law is an idiot. And a bachelor. Because clearly, the law knows nothing about wives.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Bumble and Mrs. Bumble leave.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Brownlow tells Rose that there\u2019s one more piece to the story, and that it involves her.<PARAGRAPH>Monks picks up the story of the Fleming family again: after the father died in Wales of a broken heart, his younger daughter was left there under a fake name, among strangers, without any evidence of where she\u2019d come from.<PARAGRAPH>The cottagers in the village raised her for a while.<PARAGRAPH>Monks\u2019s mother went and found the child there. Rather than take it away with her, she decided to just leave it, figuring that the cottagers were poor enough that they\u2019d grow to hate the child as a financial burden. She also told them a bunch of lies about the little girl\u2019s family\u2014that she was illegitimate, and of a bad family, and sure to go wrong at some point.<PARAGRAPH>But to Monks\u2019s mother\u2019s annoyance, the child never did go wrong in spite of all her efforts\u2014and a kindly old widow lady saw the little girl by chance and decided to take her in and raise her herself.<PARAGRAPH>Of course, that little girl was Rose, and Monks identifies her.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Maylie and Rose hug each other and cry a little bit.<PARAGRAPH>So Rose is really Oliver\u2019s aunt\u2014the baby sister of Agnes, Oliver\u2019s mother.<PARAGRAPH>They hug each other and cry some more\u2014the other folks all leave.<PARAGRAPH>Someone knocks on the door\u2014it\u2019s Harry Maylie. Oliver sneaks away so that he can talk to Rose alone.<PARAGRAPH>Harry asks her if she has changed her mind about marrying him, knowing what she now knows about her parentage.<PARAGRAPH>Rose says that her own father was so ashamed at his older daughter\u2019s dishonor that he ran away, changed his name, and died of a broken heart. So she, the younger daughter, has to deal with the same family dishonor. So, no, sorry, she can\u2019t marry Harry and be an obstacle to his social and professional advancement.<PARAGRAPH>Harry asks if she\u2019d change her mind if he changed his career path.<PARAGRAPH>What? asks Rose.<PARAGRAPH>Turns out that, after he last left her, Harry broke off all of his fancy connections, gave up his political career and his uncle\u2019s inheritance, and decided to be a minister at a little country church where no one would care that his wife\u2019s dead sister had had an illegitimate child.<PARAGRAPH>We don\u2019t get to hear Rose\u2019s answer\u2014the narrative cuts over to everyone else. They\u2019ve all been waiting on Rose and Harry for dinner for ages and ages.<PARAGRAPH>Rose and Harry finally come in, and Mr. Grimwig \"salutes the bride\" as she enters by giving her a big wet one on the cheek. Mr. Losberne and Mr. Brownlow follow suit.<PARAGRAPH>Everyone else is very happy and kissing each other indiscriminately, but little Oliver\u2019s crying.<PARAGRAPH>Because poor little Dick the angelic orphan is dead.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419220659/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/oliver-twist/summary/chapter-51"}
