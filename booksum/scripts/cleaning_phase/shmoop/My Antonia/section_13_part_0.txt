One morning Antonia and Mrs. Shimerda come over; Antonia's mother has never been in the Burdens' house before.

Jim resents that his grandmother lets them take it.<PARAGRAPH>After dinner Mrs. Shimerda tells Grandmother that if she had all the luxuries grandmother had, she would make much better food than Grandmother does. Jim isn't happy about this either.<PARAGRAPH>Antonia tells Jim that her father is very sad, because he misses his old country. He doesn't even play his violin anymore because he hates this country.<PARAGRAPH>Jim responds that people who don't like this country should have stayed home.<PARAGRAPH>Antonia explains that her mother made them come to America, thinking they would make a lot of money here. Then they argue about whether or not Jim's grandparents ought to have to help the Shimerdas.
