{"name": "Act 2, Scene 2", "summary": "Over at the Garter Inn, Falstaff refuses to loan money to Pistol, who, apparently, is always asking Falstaff for spare change.<PARAGRAPH>Pistol draws his sword and yells \"Why then, the world's mine oyster, / which I with sword will open.\" (Translation: Pistol is penniless so he's going to use his sword to make his fortune in the world.)<PARAGRAPH>Brain Snack: This is the first time this phrase appears in print so, Shakespeare either invented it or, at the very least, made it popular (source). But not as popular as Chess.<PARAGRAPH>Falstaff gets up in Pistol's face and says he's tired of always having to bail out Pistol when the guy gets caught stealing.<PARAGRAPH>Then he orders Pistol to scram and yells at him for refusing to deliver his letter to the \"merry wives.\"<PARAGRAPH>Pistol backs down. In case you hadn't noticed, Pistol is a hothead (duh, he's named after a firearm), but he's all talk.<PARAGRAPH>Just in time, Mistress Quickly shows up with messages for Falstaff from Mistress Page and Mistress Ford.<PARAGRAPH>She takes Falstaff aside and whispers that Mistress Ford is down for a secret rendezvous and that her hubby will be away the next morning between 10 and 11. (Hint, hint.) Falstaff is so totally there.<PARAGRAPH>Then, Quickly relays a separate message from Mistress Page, who says she wants a steamy hookup with Falstaff but doesn't yet know when her husband will be away.<PARAGRAPH>Falstaff wants to know if the two housewives know that he's trying to get with both of them.<PARAGRAPH>Mistress Quickly's all \"Of course not! They're totally clueless!\" Snicker.<PARAGRAPH>It's decided that Falstaff's boy servant (Robin) will act as a go-between for Falstaff and the wives.<PARAGRAPH>Falstaff gives Mistress Quickly a little monetary tip just before she runs off.<PARAGRAPH>Pistol is not happy that Falstaff just gave Mistress Quickly some money. He calls her a \"punk,\" which is fun Elizabethan slang for \"whore,\" and storms off.<PARAGRAPH>Bardolph the bartender enters and announces that a guy named \"Brooke\" is here. (Remember, \"Brooke\" is Master Ford in disguise.)<PARAGRAPH>\"Brooke\" wants to buy Falstaff a \"morning draught of sack.\" (\"Sack\" is Falstaff's favorite sweet wine and, apparently, it's never too early in the morning for a drink. Hey, they call it an \"eye-opener\" for a reason.)<PARAGRAPH>Brooke/Ford enters and offers Falstaff a huge bag of money to help him with a little problem he's having.<PARAGRAPH>Brooke/Ford says that he's been trying to hook up with Mistress Ford for-e-ver but she's too faithful to cheat on her husband.<PARAGRAPH>Falstaff's all \"Really? Tell me more about this.\"<PARAGRAPH>Brooke/Page wants Falstaff to seduce her, paving the way for \"Brooke\" to have an affair with her.<PARAGRAPH>Falstaff thinks \"Jackpot!\" and snatches up the bag of money Brooke/Ford offers.<PARAGRAPH>And now Falstaff reveals that he's actually just set up an appointment to hop in bed with Mistress Ford so, this assignment's going to be a piece of cake.<PARAGRAPH>Then Falstaff talks trash about Ford and calls him a \"poor cuckoldy knave.\" (A \"cuckold\" is a guy whose wife cheats on him and a \"knave\" is an idiot.)<PARAGRAPH>Left alone on stage, Master Ford is furious. He delivers a creepy soliloquy about getting revenge against Falstaff and his wife.<PARAGRAPH>Here's a little sample of what he says:<PARAGRAPH>\"See the hell of having a false woman! My bed shall be abused, my coffers ransacked, my reputation gnawn at.\" Yikes! (By the way, a soliloquy is just a speech that reveals a character's innermost thoughts. Characters like Master Ford and Hamlet are big on soliloquies.)", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20211017012900/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/merry-wives-of-windsor/summary/act-2-scene-2"}
