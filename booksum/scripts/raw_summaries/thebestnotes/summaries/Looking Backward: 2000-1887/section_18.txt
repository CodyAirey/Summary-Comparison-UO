{"name": "chapter xviii", "summary": "That evening Doctor Leete and Julian West have another talk. Julian \n        West is surprised at the early age of retirement. He thinks it seems too \n        early to put people out of work when they have plenty of good years ahead \n        of them. Doctor Leete answers that people work only for duty, but they \n        all look forward to the age of forty five as the best time of their life \n        because it begins the time of \u0093the higher and larger activities.\u0094 If they \n        are not interested in independent scholarship or art, they can simply \n        travel and live a leisurely existence. They also discuss the sports of \n        the twentieth century. The prizes are never monetary. The various guilds \n        compete against one another with a healthy rivalry.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025235/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Looking_Backward_Bellamy/Looking_Backward_Study_Guide14.html"}
