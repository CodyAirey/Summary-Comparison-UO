Canto XXXIV. Hanuman's Speech.


Thus spoke the dame in mournful mood,
And Hanuman his speech renewed:
"O lady, by thy lord's decree
I come a messenger to thee.
Thy lord is safe with steadfast friends,
And greeting to his queen he sends,
And Lakshman, ever faithful bows
His reverent head to Rama's spouse."

  Through all her frame the rapture ran,
As thus again the dame began:
"Now verily the truth I know
Of the wise saw of long ago:
"Once only in a hundred years
True joy to living man appears."

  He marked her rapture-beaming hue,
And nearer to the lady drew,
But at each onward step he took
Suspicious fear her spirit shook.
"Alas, Alas," she cried in fear.
"False is the tale I joyed to hear.
'Tis Ravan, 'tis the fiend, who tries
To mock me with a new disguise.
If thou, to wring my woman's heart,
Hast changed thy shape by magic art,
And wouldst a helpless dame beguile,
The wicked deed is doubly vile.
But no: that fiend thou canst not be:
Such joy I had from seeing thee.
But if my fancy does not err,
And thou art Rama's messenger,
The glories of my lord repeat:
For to these ears such words are sweet."

  The Vanar knew the lady's thought,(856)
And gave the answer fondly sought:
"Bright as the sun that lights the sky
Dear as the Moon to every eye.
He scatters blessings o'er the land
Like bounties from Vaisravan's(857) hand.
Like Vishnu strong and unsubdued,
Unmatched in might and fortitude.
Wise, truthful as the Lord of Speech,
With gentle words he welcomes each.
Of noblest mould and form is he,
Like love's incarnate deity.
He quells the fury of the foe,
And strikes when justice prompts the blow.
Safe in the shadow of his arm
The world is kept from scathe and harm.
Now soon shall Ravan rue his theft,
And fall, of realm and life bereft.
For Rama's wrathful hand shall wing
His shafts against the giant king.
The day, O Maithil Queen, is near
When he and Lakshman will be here,
And by their side Sugriva lead
His countless hosts of Vanar breed.
Sugriva's servant, I, by name
Hanuman, by his order came.
With desperate leap I crossed the sea
To Lanka's isle in search of thee,
No traitor, gentle dame, am I:
Upon my word and faith rely."
