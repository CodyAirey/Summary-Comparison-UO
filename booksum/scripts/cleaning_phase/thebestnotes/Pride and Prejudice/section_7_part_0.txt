{"name": "chapter 8", "summary": "After dinner, Elizabeth returns to Jane, who is not improving. Elizabeth is very touched by Mr. Bingleys genuine \nconcern for her ailing sister and the attention he pays to both of them; he is the only one that does not make her feel \nlike an intruder at Netherfield.<PARAGRAPH>After Elizabeth departs from dinner, Miss Bingley begins to criticize her manners, saying that Elizabeth is a crude \nmixture of pride and impertinence and that she lacks style and grace. Mrs. Hurst agrees with her whole-heartedly and \nagain describes the slovenly fashion in which Elizabeth has arrived at Netherfield. Mr. Bingley defends Elizabeth, \npraising her independent spirit and her great concern for her sister. Darcy remarks that the walk had illumined \nElizabeths fine eyes.<PARAGRAPH>Later in the evening, Elizabeth joins the party in the drawing room, where \n        everyone is engaged in a game of cards. Elizabeth declines to play, preferring \n        to read a book. Miss Bingley makes catty remarks about her choice, but \n        Mr. Bingley kindly brings Elizabeth some books from his modest collection. \n        The conversation turns to Darcys fine home, Pemberley, with its imposing \n        library. The mention of Pemberley excites Miss Bingley, and she pays exaggerated \n        tributes to Darcys house and his accomplished sister. There are subtle \n        overtones of criticism targeted at Elizabeth in Miss Bingleys observations.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025227/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Pride_And_Prejudice_Austen/Pride_And_Prejudice_Study_Guide09.html"}
