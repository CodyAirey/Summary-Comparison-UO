{"name": "chapter 27", "summary": "The train continues \non its path. Passepartout steps down at a station, when he sees an interesting \nman-tall, very dark, who looked like a parson. This man goes from one part of \nthe train to another and announces that he will give a lecture on Mormonism in \ncar No. 117. Thirty people are drawn by the attraction of a lecture, including \nPassepartout. The Mormon missionary-Elder William Hitch turns out to be a fanatic \nand one by one, people start leaving the lecture room. Passepartout is the last \nto escape the tedious preaching. During the lecture, the train had made rapid \nprogress and the landscape is outlined. The train stops at Ogden for a few hours \nand so the travelers alight. The town is described through the visiting travelers\u2019 \neye and the voyagers do not feel sorry about leaving this City of Saints. Just \nas the train starts, a breathless Mormon man runs up and he is late because of \na domestic fight. Passepartout asks him how many wives he has and they learn that \nhe has only one wife unlike other Mormons.<PARAGRAPH>Notes\nA major part of this chapter is devoted to Mormonism-the theory, its culture, \na Mormon missionary and his fanaticism as well as a Mormon town. Passepartout \ngoes to attend the Mormon missionary\u2019s lecture out of curiosity but finds it very \nboring, as the others do too. Verne does have a large landscape in the background \nof his story and apart from various places various religions are described too-Mormonism \nis one such practice. But we can feel that the author is not too appreciative \nof this way of life.<PARAGRAPH>Ogden is another American City that we are led through. \nWe are also told that the travelers are not sorry to leave it. This city of Saints \nis not exactly a very colorful place and Mormons on the whole are a simple lot.<PARAGRAPH>This is one chapter in which the focus is not on the hero and his experiences, \nbut on his valet, Passepartout\u2019s experiences. Apart from that, the emphasis is \nalso on Mormonism and the chapter ends also with a Mormon rushing into the train. \nHe is late because of a domestic fight. Verne seems to underline at the end that \none wife is more than enough to make a man go crazy, he doesn\u2019t need to have two-three \nto make him mad. It does look like a chauvinistic viewpoint to present.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141554/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Around_The_World_In_80_Days/Around_The_World_In_Eighty_Days26.html"}
