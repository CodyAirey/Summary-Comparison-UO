ACT I. SCENE I. _An apartment in the DUKE'S palace._





  _Enter DUKE, ESCALUS, _Lords_ and _Attendants_._

_Duke._ Escalus.

_Escal._ My lord.

_Duke._ Of government the properties to unfold,
Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse;
Since I am put to know that your own science                         5
Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
My strength can give you: then no more remains,
But that to your sufficiency . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . as your worth is able,
And let them work. The nature of our people,                        10
Our city's institutions, and the terms
For common justice, you're as pregnant in
As art and practice hath enriched any
That we remember. There is our commission,
From which we would not have you warp. Call hither,                 15
I say, bid come before us Angelo.    [_Exit an Attendant._
What figure of us think you he will bear?
For you must know, we have with special soul
Elected him our absence to supply;
Lent him our terror, dress'd him with our love,                     20
And given his deputation all the organs
Of our own power: what think you of it?

_Escal._ If any in Vienna be of worth
To undergo such ample grace and honour,
It is Lord Angelo.

_Duke._          Look where he comes.                               25

  _Enter ANGELO._

_Ang._ Always obedient to your Grace's will,
I come to know your pleasure.

_Duke._                     Angelo,
There is a kind of character in thy life,
That to th' observer doth thy history
Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings                            30
Are not thine own so proper, as to waste
Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.
Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,
Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues
Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike                            35
As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd
But to fine issues; nor Nature never lends
The smallest scruple of her excellence,
But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines
Herself the glory of a creditor,                                    40
Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech
To one that can my part in him advertise;
Hold therefore, Angelo:--
In our remove be thou at full ourself;
Mortality and mercy in Vienna                                       45
Live in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus,
Though first in question, is thy secondary.
Take thy commission.

_Ang._             Now, good my lord,
Let there be some more test made of my metal,
Before so noble and so great a figure                               50
Be stamp'd upon it.

_Duke._           No more evasion:
We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice
Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours.
Our haste from hence is of so quick condition,
That it prefers itself, and leaves unquestion'd                     55
Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,
As time and our concernings shall importune,
How it goes with us; and do look to know
What doth befall you here. So, fare you well:
To the hopeful execution do I leave you                             60
Of your commissions.

_Ang._             Yet, give leave, my lord,
That we may bring you something on the way.

_Duke._ My haste may not admit it;
Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do
With any scruple; your scope is as mine own,                        65
So to enforce or qualify the laws
As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand:
I'll privily away. I love the people,
But do not like to stage me to their eyes:
Though it do well, I do not relish well                             70
Their loud applause and Aves vehement;
Nor do I think the man of safe discretion
That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.

_Ang._ The heavens give safety to your purposes!

_Escal._ Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!                75

_Duke._ I thank you. Fare you well.    [_Exit._

_Escal._ I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave
To have free speech with you; and it concerns me
To look into the bottom of my place:
A power I have, but of what strength and nature                     80
I am not yet instructed.

_Ang._ 'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,
And we may soon our satisfaction have
Touching that point.

_Escal._           I'll wait upon your honour.    [_Exeunt._

SCENE II. 

_A street._

  _Enter LUCIO and two _Gentlemen_._

_Lucio._ If the duke, with the other dukes, come not to
composition with the King of Hungary, why then all the
dukes fall upon the king.

_First Gent._ Heaven grant us its peace, but not the
King of Hungary's!                                                   5

_Sec. Gent._ Amen.

_Lucio._ Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate,
that went to sea with the Ten Commandments, but scraped
one out of the table.

_Sec. Gent._ 'Thou shalt not steal'?                                10

_Lucio._ Ay, that he razed.

_First Gent._ Why, 'twas a commandment to command
the captain and all the rest from their functions: they put
forth to steal. There's not a soldier of us all, that, in the
thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petition well that          15
prays for peace.

_Sec. Gent._ I never heard any soldier dislike it.

_Lucio._ I believe thee; for I think thou never wast
where grace was said.

_Sec. Gent._ No? a dozen times at least.                            20

_First Gent._ What, in metre?

_Lucio._ In any proportion or in any language.

_First Gent._ I think, or in any religion.

_Lucio._ Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all
controversy: as, for example, thou thyself art a wicked             25
villain, despite of all grace.

_First Gent._ Well, there went but a pair of shears between
us.

_Lucio._ I grant; as there may between the lists and the
velvet. Thou art the list.                                          30

_First Gent._ And thou the velvet: thou art good velvet;
thou'rt a three-piled piece, I warrant thee: I had as lief
be a list of an English kersey, as be piled, as thou art
piled, for a French velvet. Do I speak feelingly now?

_Lucio._ I think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painful          35
feeling of thy speech: I will, out of thine own confession,
learn to begin thy health; but, whilst I live, forget to
drink after thee.

_First Gent._ I think I have done myself wrong, have
I not?                                                              40

_Sec. Gent._ Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted
or free.

_Lucio._ Behold, behold, where Madam Mitigation
comes! I have purchased as many diseases under her roof
as come to--                                                        45

_Sec. Gent._ To what, I pray?

_Lucio._ Judge.

_Sec. Gent._ To three thousand dolours a year.

_First Gent._ Ay, and more.

_Lucio._ A French crown more.                                       50

_First Gent._ Thou art always figuring diseases in me;
but thou art full of error; I am sound.

_Lucio._ Nay, not as one would say, healthy; but so
sound as things that are hollow: thy bones are hollow;
impiety has made a feast of thee.                                   55

  _Enter MISTRESS OVERDONE._

_First Gent._ How now! which of your hips has the
most profound sciatica?

_Mrs Ov._ Well, well; there's one yonder arrested and
carried to prison was worth five thousand of you all.

_Sec. Gent._ Who's that, I pray thee?                               60

_Mrs Ov._ Marry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio.

_First Gent._ Claudio to prison? 'tis not so.

_Mrs Ov._ Nay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested;
saw him carried away; and, which is more, within these
three days his head to be chopped off.                              65

_Lucio._ But, after all this fooling, I would not have it
so. Art thou sure of this?

_Mrs Ov._ I am too sure of it: and it is for getting
Madam Julietta with child.

_Lucio._ Believe me, this may be: he promised to meet               70
me two hours since, and he was ever precise in promise-keeping.

_Sec. Gent._ Besides, you know, it draws something near
to the speech we had to such a purpose.

_First Gent._ But, most of all, agreeing with the proclamation.     75

_Lucio._ Away! let's go learn the truth of it.

    [_Exeunt Lucio and Gentlemen._

_Mrs Ov._ Thus, what with the war, what with the
sweat, what with the gallows, and what with poverty, I am
custom-shrunk.                                                      80

  _Enter POMPEY._

How now! what's the news with you?

_Pom._ Yonder man is carried to prison.

_Mrs Ov._ Well; what has he done?

_Pom._ A woman.

_Mrs Ov._ But what's his offence?                                   85

_Pom._ Groping for trouts in a peculiar river.

_Mrs Ov._ What, is there a maid with child by him?

_Pom._ No, but there's a woman with maid by him.
You have not heard of the proclamation, have you?

_Mrs Ov._ What proclamation, man?                                   90

_Pom._ All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be
plucked down.

_Mrs Ov._ And what shall become of those in the city?

_Pom._ They shall stand for seed: they had gone down
too, but that a wise burgher put in for them.                       95

_Mrs Ov._ But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs
be pulled down?

_Pom._ To the ground, mistress.

_Mrs Ov._ Why, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth!
What shall become of me?                                           100

_Pom._ Come; fear not you: good counsellors lack no
clients: though you change your place, you need not
change your trade; I'll be your tapster still. Courage!
there will be pity taken on you: you that have worn your
eyes almost out in the service, you will be considered.            105

_Mrs Ov._ What's to do here, Thomas tapster? let's
withdraw.

_Pom._ Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the provost
to prison; and there's Madam Juliet.    [_Exeunt._

  _Enter PROVOST, CLAUDIO, JULIET, and _Officers_._

_Claud._ Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world?          110
Bear me to prison, where I am committed.

_Prov._ I do it not in evil disposition,
But from Lord Angelo by special charge.

_Claud._ Thus can the demigod Authority
Make us pay down for our offence by weight                         115
The words of heaven;--on whom it will, it will;
On whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just.

  _Re-enter LUCIO and two _Gentlemen_._

_Lucio._ Why, how now, Claudio! whence comes this restraint?

_Claud._ From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty:
As surfeit is the father of much fast,                             120
So every scope by the immoderate use
Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,
Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,
A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.

_Lucio._ If I could speak so wisely under an arrest, I             125
would send for certain of my creditors: and yet, to say the
truth, I had as lief have the foppery of freedom as the
morality of imprisonment. What's thy offence, Claudio?

_Claud._ What but to speak of would offend again.

_Lucio._ What, is't murder?                                        130

_Claud._ No.

_Lucio._ Lechery?

_Claud._ Call it so.

_Prov._ Away, sir! you must go.

_Claud._ One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.            135

_Lucio._ A hundred, if they'll do you any good.
Is lechery so look'd after?

_Claud._ Thus stands it with me:--upon a true contract
I got possession of Julietta's bed:
You know the lady; she is fast my wife,                            140
Save that we do the denunciation lack
Of outward order: this we came not to,
Only for propagation of a dower
Remaining in the coffer of her friends;
From whom we thought it meet to hide our love                      145
Till time had made them for us. But it chances
The stealth of our most mutual entertainment
With character too gross is writ on Juliet.

_Lucio._ With child, perhaps?

_Claud._                    Unhappily, even so.
And the new Deputy now for the Duke,--                             150
Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,
Or whether that the body public be
A horse whereon the governor doth ride,
Who, newly in the seat, that it may know
He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;                    155
Whether the tyranny be in his place,
Or in his eminence that fills it up.
I stagger in:--but this new governor
Awakes me all the enrolled penalties
Which have, like unscour'd armour, hung by the wall
So long, that nineteen zodiacs have gone round,
And none of them been worn; and, for a name,
Now puts the drowsy and neglected act
Freshly on me: 'tis surely for a name.

_Lucio._ I warrant it is: and thy head stands so tickle            165
on thy shoulders, that a milkmaid, if she be in love, may
sigh it off. Send after the duke, and appeal to him.

_Claud._ I have done so, but he's not to be found.
I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:
This day my sister should the cloister enter                       170
And there receive her approbation:
Acquaint her with the danger of my state;
Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends
To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him:
I have great hope in that; for in her youth                        175
There is a prone and speechless dialect,
Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art
When she will play with reason and discourse,
And well she can persuade.

_Lucio._ I pray she may; as well for the encouragement             180
of the like, which else would stand under grievous imposition,
as for the enjoying of thy life, who I would be sorry
should be thus foolishly lost at a game of tick-tack. I'll
to her.

_Claud._ I thank you, good friend Lucio.                           185

_Lucio._ Within two hours.

_Claud._                 Come, officer, away!

    [_Exeunt._

SCENE III. 

_A monastery._

  _Enter _Duke_ and FRIAR THOMAS._

_Duke._ No, holy father; throw away that thought;
Believe not that the dribbling dart of love
Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee
To give me secret harbour, hath a purpose
More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends                       5
Of burning youth.

_Fri. T._    May your grace speak of it?

_Duke._ My holy sir, none better knows than you
How I have ever loved the life removed,
And held in idle price to haunt assemblies
Where youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps.                   10
I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,
A man of stricture and firm abstinence,
My absolute power and place here in Vienna,
And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;
For so I have strew'd it in the common ear,                         15
And so it is received. Now, pious sir,
You will demand of me why I do this?

_Fri. T._ Gladly, my lord.

_Duke._ We have strict statutes and most biting laws,
The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,                     20
Which for this fourteen years we have let slip;
Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,
That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,
Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch,
Only to stick it in their children's sight                          25
For terror, not to use, in time the rod
Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees.
Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;
And liberty plucks justice by the nose;
The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart                         30
Goes all decorum.

_Fri. T._    It rested in your Grace
To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased:
And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd
Than in Lord Angelo.

_Duke._            I do fear, too dreadful:
Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,                       35
'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
For what I bid them do: for we bid this be done,
When evil deeds have their permissive pass,
And not the punishment. Therefore, indeed, my father,
I have on Angelo imposed the office;                                40
Who may, in the ambush of my name, strike home,
And yet my nature never in the fight
To do in slander. And to behold his sway,
I will, as 'twere a brother of your order,
Visit both prince and people: therefore, I prithee,                 45
Supply me with the habit, and instruct me
How I may formally in person bear me
Like a true friar. More reasons for this action
At our more leisure shall I render you;
Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;                             50
Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses
That his blood flows, or that his appetite
Is more to bread than stone: hence shall we see,
If power change purpose, what our seemers be.    [_Exeunt._

SCENE IV. 

_A nunnery._

  _Enter ISABELLA and FRANCISCA._

_Isab._ And have you nuns no farther privileges?

_Fran._ Are not these large enough?

_Isab._ Yes, truly: I speak not as desiring more;
But rather wishing a more strict restraint
Upon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare.                   5

_Lucio_ [_within_]. Ho! Peace be in this place!

_Isab._                                 Who's that which calls?

_Fran._ It is a man's voice. Gentle Isabella,
Turn you the key, and know his business of him;
You may, I may not; you are yet unsworn.
When you have vow'd, you must not speak with men                    10
But in the presence of the prioress:
Then, if you speak, you must not show your face;
Or, if you show your face, you must not speak.
He calls again; I pray you, answer him.    [_Exit._

_Isab._ Peace and prosperity! Who is't that calls?                  15

  _Enter LUCIO._

_Lucio._ Hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses
Proclaim you are no less! Can you so stead me
As bring me to the sight of Isabella,
A novice of this place, and the fair sister
To her unhappy brother Claudio?                                     20

_Isab._ Why, 'her unhappy brother'? let me ask
The rather, for I now must make you know
I am that Isabella and his sister.

_Lucio._ Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you:
Not to be weary with you, he's in prison.                           25

_Isab._ Woe me! for what?

_Lucio._ For that which, if myself might be his judge,
He should receive his punishment in thanks:
He hath got his friend with child.

_Isab._ Sir, make me not your story.

_Lucio._                           It is true.                      30
I would not--though 'tis my familiar sin
With maids to seem the lapwing, and to jest,
Tongue far from heart--play with all virgins so:
I hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted;
By your renouncement, an immortal spirit;                           35
And to be talk'd with in sincerity,
As with a saint.

_Isab._ You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.

_Lucio._ Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus:--
Your brother and his lover have embraced:                           40
As those that feed grow full,--as blossoming time,
That from the seedness the bare fallow brings
To teeming foison,--even so her plenteous womb
Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry.

_Isab._ Some one with child by him?--My cousin Juliet?              45

_Lucio._ Is she your cousin?

_Isab._ Adoptedly; as school-maids change their names
By vain, though apt, affection.

_Lucio._                      She it is.

_Isab._ O, let him marry her.

_Lucio._                    This is the point.
The duke is very strangely gone from hence;                         50
Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,
In hand, and hope of action: but we do learn
By those that know the very nerves of state,
His givings-out were of an infinite distance
From his true-meant design. Upon his place,                         55
And with full line of his authority,
Governs Lord Angelo; a man whose blood
Is very snow-broth; one who never feels
The wanton stings and motions of the sense,
But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge                          60
With profits of the mind, study and fast.
He--to give fear to use and liberty,
Which have for long run by the hideous law,
As mice by lions--hath pick'd out an act,
Under whose heavy sense your brother's life                         65
Falls into forfeit: he arrests him on it;
And follows close the rigour of the statute,
To make him an example. All hope is gone,
Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
To soften Angelo: and that's my pith of business                    70
'Twixt you and your poor brother.

_Isab._ Doth he so seek his life?

_Lucio._                        Has censured him
Already; and, as I hear, the provost hath
A warrant for his execution.

_Isab._ Alas! what poor ability's in me                             75
To do him good?

_Lucio._      Assay the power you have.

_Isab._ My power? Alas, I doubt,--

_Lucio._                         Our doubts are traitors,
And make us lose the good we oft might win
By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,
And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,                        80
Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,
All their petitions are as freely theirs
As they themselves would owe them.

_Isab._ I'll see what I can do.

_Lucio._                      But speedily.

_Isab._ I will about it straight;                                   85
No longer staying but to give the Mother
Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you:
Commend me to my brother: soon at night
I'll send him certain word of my success.

_Lucio._ I take my leave of you.

_Isab._                        Good sir, adieu.                     90
