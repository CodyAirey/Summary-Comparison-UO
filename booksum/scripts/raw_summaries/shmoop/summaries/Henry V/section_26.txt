{"name": "Act 5, Scene 1", "summary": "Back at the English camp in France, Fluellen and Gower talk about why Fluellen is wearing a leek (kind of like an onion) in his hat, even though St. Davy's Day was yesterday (March 1).<PARAGRAPH>Brain Snack: For the Welsh, wearing a leek in one's hat on St. Davy's Day was as patriotic as Americans eating too many hotdogs and lighting fireworks on Independence Day.<PARAGRAPH>Fluellen tells us that he's still wearing the leek because, yesterday, Pistol insulted him by sending him some salt and bread (to eat with the leek).<PARAGRAPH>When Pistol shows up, Fluellen beats him severely and crams the leek in his mouth.<PARAGRAPH>Then Fluellen gives Pistol some money and tells him to scram.<PARAGRAPH>Gower points out that Pistol got what was coming to him. Next time, Pistol will think twice before messing with a guy just because he's got a whacky Welsh accent.<PARAGRAPH>Left alone on stage, Pistol relates some sad news: His wife, Mistress Quickly, has died of venereal disease. (Just like Falstaff.)<PARAGRAPH>Pistol decides that, since he no longer has a wife to go home to, he's going to become a pimp.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210516192621/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/henry-v/summary/act-5-scene-1"}
