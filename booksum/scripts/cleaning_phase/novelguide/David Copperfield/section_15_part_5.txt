It is Mr. Peggotty, who looks strong and healthy. Mr. Peggotty reports that he and Little Em'ly have a farm, and though they have had to work hard, they are prosperous. Little Em'ly has received many proposals of marriage, but has refused them. She devotes herself to doing acts of kindness for the poor and needy. Martha has married a farm laborer. Even Mrs. Gummidge received a marriage proposal from a cook, but her reply was to put a bucket over his head, from which Mr. Peggotty had to extricate him. Mrs. Gummidge is no longer \"lone and lorn,\" but works willingly and no longer thinks about her dead husband. David asks after Mr. Micawber, who has paid off all his debts in England. Mr. Peggotty reports that Mr. Micawber too has worked hard on the land, but is now a magistrate and a distinguished person in the community. Mr. Peggotty stays with David and Agnes for a few weeks, and then returns to Australia. They never see him again", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210214143214/https://www.novelguide.com/david-copperfield/summaries/chapters-lix-lxiv"}
