{"name": "Chapter 1", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820044717/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmReturnNative26.asp", "summary": "Clym takes his mother's death hard and falls sick, feeling guilty and remorseful at the memory of his mother's last words. He blames himself for her death, and neither Eustacia's sense nor Thomasin's sensibility can shake him from the conviction that he is responsible. When Thomasin comes to visit Clym, Wildeve comes later to call for his wife. Eustacia take the opportunity to tell him of her misery. Wildeve talks to her about Mrs. Yeobright's death and convinces Eustacia not to tell Clym that he had been in the house on that fateful day.", "analysis": "Notes Clym's grief is almost irrational. He chastises himself and rues his mother's death. All of this has the effect of making Eustacia more guilt-ridden. She realizes that it will be only a matter of time before Clym knows the truth surrounding the events on that fateful. His ranting is really the calm before the storm. She feels sick with apprehension and waits fearfully."}
