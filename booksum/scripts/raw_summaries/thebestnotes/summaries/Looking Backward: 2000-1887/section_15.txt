{"name": "chapter xv", "summary": "The characters next visit the library of a social club. It is very comfortable \n        and books are easily accessible. Julian West contrasts this scene to the \n        libraries of the nineteenth century, when books were closely guarded and \n        borrowing was difficult. Mrs. Leete and Edith Leete tell Julian West of \n        the joy he will have in reading the twentieth-century writers. The subject \n        brings up more economic questions, this time about how writers are paid. \n        Doctor Leete explains that anyone who writes a book must pay for the cost \n        of its printing out of his own credit. Then, if the book is accepted by \n        the public, the writer is compensated. If the book is liked well enough, \n        the writer could receive enough credit to take time off from the industrial \n        army in order to write. Depending on how well his books sell, the writer \n        could possibly write full time for many years. Because everyone is so \n        well educated, the public is qualified to judge whether a writer is producing \n        good literature. And since there is no favoritism at play, every writer \n        has the same chance.<PARAGRAPH>Julian West asks about the other arts. Doctor Leete explains that all \n        the arts operate on similar lines, except that people vote on accepting \n        statues and paintings for public buildings. There are also literary, artistic, \n        and scientific institutes that support creative thinkers. These carry \n        even more prestige than the presidency.<PARAGRAPH>Next, Julian West inquires about newspapers and periodicals. He assumes \n        that these must be published by the state and therefore are subject to \n        censorship. Julian West expresses the commonly held belief that the newspaper \n        presses were \u0093free\u0094 in the nineteenth century, since they were not owned \n        by the government. Doctor Leete notes, however, that the newspapers of \n        the nineteenth century were not \u0093the best vehicle for social criticism\u0094 \n        because they were used as a moneymaking business and served only secondarily \n        as a mouthpiece for the people. He adds that from what he has seen of \n        nineteenth-century newspapers, their journalism was not that impressive. \n        They usually made \u0093crude and flippant\u0094 judgments that were also deeply \n        colored by prejudice. If they expressed the public opinion of the time, \n        they likewise give a poor impression of popular intelligence in the nineteenth \n        century.<PARAGRAPH>In the twentieth century, if a person has a serious opinion, it is published \n        in a book or pamphlet. There are newspapers, however, which are paid for \n        by subscriptions. People who take the paper pay for its publication and \n        choose its editor. After Julian West has learned how the contributors \n        to the papers are paid, and how the subscribers exert their influence \n        on the editor, he exclaims over the fact that no one in this society seems \n        to be able to get out of work. Doctor Leete agrees, but he adds that if \n        a man wants to stop working at the age of thirty-three, he can take a \n        reduction in maintenance.<PARAGRAPH>That night, Edith Leete brings him a copy of her favorite writer, Berrian. \n        Julian West reads it far into the night. He finds it fascinating, not \n        only for its literary merit, but for its subject matter. He contrasts \n        it to the novels of his own time. The novels of earlier centuries hinged \n        on conflict that was almost always class based. For instance, the difficulties \n        of lovers from different economic classes was commonly featured. Berrian\u0092s \n        novel, Penthesilia, gives Julian West a clear view of the vast \n        changes in this new society.<PARAGRAPH>The next morning, when Julian West leaves his room, Edith Leete comes \n        out of the dining room to check on him. He realizes she has been getting \n        up very early every morning to make sure he does not leave the house because \n        she fears that he will have another crisis. He is very touched by her \n        concern and calls her an angel. He asks her if she knows who her nineteenth-century \n        ancestors were. She says she does, but then she is too absorbed in arranging \n        the flowers to tell him their names.<PARAGRAPH>Doctor Leete comes in, and Julian West takes up the question of what \n        he should do to enter the system of this new society. Doctor Leete tells \n        him that he is quite happy to have him as a guest for a long time since \n        he is so interesting. He adds that when the time comes, Julian West might \n        like to take up a lectureship at one of the universities teaching nineteenth-century \n        history. Julian West is greatly relieved at this news.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025235/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Looking_Backward_Bellamy/Looking_Backward_Study_Guide13.html"}
