Oops.<PARAGRAPH>She finally admits that she wrote to Sir Charles asking to meet him.<PARAGRAPH>She explains why she kept it secret: hello, it's rural England in 1901, a married woman can't just visit an unmarried guy at night without it being a huge scandal.<PARAGRAPH>The one thing she won't explain is why she never went to the meeting. She just swears that she made the appointment, but she never went to Baskerville Hall.<PARAGRAPH>She says she received the help she needed from \"another source\" .<PARAGRAPH>Watson is sure there's more to the story than Laura will tell him, but she never changes her answers.<PARAGRAPH>He realizes she must have been asking for money for a divorce, but why so urgently right now?<PARAGRAPH>Watson goes back to Baskerville Hall.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Frankland sees him passing by in his carriage and calls him over for a drink.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Frankland starts bragging because he knows something the cops don't know--and he won't tell them.<PARAGRAPH>Apparently, there's a boy that has been carrying food to a man hidden near a large hill called Black Tor.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Frankland has been keeping watch with his telescope because he thinks the man is the murderous Selden.<PARAGRAPH>Even as they're talking about it, the boy appears on his twice daily errand of sneaking over the moors with food for the mysterious man.<PARAGRAPH>Watson ditches Mr. Frankland and goes out onto the moors to follow the boy's tracks.<PARAGRAPH>He finds a circle of old stone huts, and he discovers one that's clearly being lived in.<PARAGRAPH>Inside the hut, there's a note: \"Dr. Watson has gone to Coombe Tracey\" .<PARAGRAPH>Watson realizes that the mystery man has been following him.<PARAGRAPH>But he can't find any other signs of the man's identity. <PARAGRAPH>Watson sits and waits nervously for the man to return.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, he hears the sound of someone approaching.<PARAGRAPH>And he hears a familiar voice inviting him to come outside, where it's more comfortable.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210508135841/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/hound-of-the-baskervilles/summary/chapter-11"}
