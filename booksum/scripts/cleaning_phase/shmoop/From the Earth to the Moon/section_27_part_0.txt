{"name": "Chapter 28", "summary": "That night, the Gun Club receives a message from J.T. Maston at the Cambridge Observatory--he has seen the capsule.<PARAGRAPH>Unfortunately, though, it \"has not reached its goal\"  and is instead orbiting the moon. There are two possible outcomes: Either the capsule will eventually get pulled to the moon's surface, or it will continue its orbit forever. Uh oh...<PARAGRAPH>Everyone thinks that it's a hopeless cause--everyone, that is, except the indefatigable J.T. Maston. Gosh darn it, nobody breaks this guy's stride.<PARAGRAPH>No matter what anyone says, Maston has full confidence that the three astronauts will manage to \"get out of their difficulties\" . We sure hope so, Maston--we sure hope so.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219163439/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/from-the-earth-to-the-moon/summary/chapter-28"}
