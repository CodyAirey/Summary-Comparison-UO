{"name": "Chapter 33", "summary": "Chapter 33 Summary Jewel confided in Marlow that she did not want to die weeping like her mother. Marlow was overwhelmed by the girl's fear and grief. He tried to convince her that Jim would never leave her, that Jim was truer than any man; but she remained doubtful and apprehensive. Her ignorance made her an object of pity. Marlow, wondering if Jim had told Jewel about the Patna, asked her what she knew about his past life. Jewel said she knew nothing, that he had only assured her that he would never leave her. Marlow explained that Jim had no one in the other world. When asked why, Marlow answered that he was not good enough. Jewel did not believe him. Notes This chapter, an important one in the novel, has a very serious Mood. It shows the nature of Jewel's fears of being destroyed by a white man. Marlow assures Jewel that Jim will never leave Patusan. This is true, as long as no one discovers Jim's past or his guilt. Marlow feels that Jim does not permanently belong in Patusan; however, he knows Jim can never go back to England where he belongs. Marlow feels this fact makes Jim's existence tragic. Before he departs, he assures Jewel that he will never come back to Patusan, so she need not fear him.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820051943/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmLordJim42.asp"}
