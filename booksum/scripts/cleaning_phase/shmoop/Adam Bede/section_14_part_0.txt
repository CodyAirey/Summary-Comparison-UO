{"name": "Chapter 15", "summary": "Hetty and Dinah are both getting ready for bed \"in rooms adjoining each other, meagerly furnished rooms, with no blinds to shut out the light\" . And that's pretty much where the similarities stop. Adjoining rooms or no adjoining rooms, the two girls are worlds away--personality-wise, that is.<PARAGRAPH>Here's what Hetty cares about: her pretty hair, her reputation as a local beauty, and her trinkets. As she gets ready for bed, she parades around with \"large ear-rings in her ears\" and a \"black lace scarf adjusted round her shoulders\" . How could Arthur resist? Soon, Hetty thinks, he'll take her away from those humdrum Poysers and make her a real lady. And that'll be the end of her little bedroom parade routine.<PARAGRAPH>Here's what Dinah cares about: the \"wide view over the fields\" from her bedroom window, God, and her Bible . As she prepares for bed, she reflects compassionately on all the people she's helped. But she's concerned about Hetty, \"that sweet young thing with life and all its trials before her\" .<PARAGRAPH>Seeking divine guidance for this difficult case, Dinah opens her Bible and points at a random passage. She hits upon a passage about St. Paul, weeping, compassion, what you will. And this convinces her to pay a visit to Hetty's room.<PARAGRAPH>Hetty is still in the middle of her scarf-and-earrings routine when Dinah comes in. But Dinah wants to tell Hetty that, \"if ever you are in trouble, and need a fried that will always feel for you and love you, you have got that friend in Dinah Morris\" .<PARAGRAPH>Hetty isn't sure where this is coming from. So Dinah talks to her about trials, and suffering, and makes Hetty cry. Wow, Hetty cries at the drop of a hat. So Dinah says some kind words before heading out. Then Hetty turns off her waterworks, and goes to sleep.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210630082925/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/adam-bede/summary/chapter-15"}
