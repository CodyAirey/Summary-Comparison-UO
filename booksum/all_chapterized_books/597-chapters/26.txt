26. OF ASGRIM AND HIS CHILDREN

There was a man named Asgrim (1).  He was Ellidagrim's son.  The
brother of Asgrim Ellidagrim's son was Sigfus (2).  Gauk
Trandil's son was Asgrim's foster-brother, who is said to have
been the fairest man of his day, and best skilled in all things;
but matters went ill with them, for Asgrim slew Gauk.

Asgrim had two sons, and each of them was named Thorhall.  They
were both hopeful men.  Grim was the name of another of Asgrim's
sons, and Thorhalla was his daughter's name.  She was the fairest
of women, and well behaved.

Njal came to talk with his son Helgi, and said, "I have thought
of a match for thee, if thou wilt follow my advice."

"That I will surely," says he, "for I know that thou both meanest
me well, and canst do well for me; but whither hast thou turned
thine eyes."

"We will go and woo Asgrim Ellidagrim's son's daughter, for that
is the best choice we can make."
