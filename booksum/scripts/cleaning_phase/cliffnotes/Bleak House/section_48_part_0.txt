On that day, the pompous, wordy Vholes relentlessly pursues the theme that Richard needs money . Learning finally that Richard lives next door, upstairs, Allan visits him and finds the young man haggard and dejected -- he has made no progress with his interests in the Chancery suit -- but quite agreeable to receive advice and direction from Allan.

The marriage of Ada and Richard in such unpropitious circumstances darkens the story's atmosphere further, as it now seems inevitable that Richard's ominous future will also be Ada's.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201101003913/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/b/bleak-house/summary-and-analysis/chapter-51"}
