Finally, he decides it will be best if the Defarges know what he looks like.<PARAGRAPH>Accordingly, he scouts out the wine-shop in Saint Antoine.<PARAGRAPH>Once he finds it, he has dinner and takes a nap. At seven, he heads over to the wine-shop.<PARAGRAPH>Madame Defarge, of course, is sitting at the till.<PARAGRAPH>Carton heads over to the bar and asks for some wine.<PARAGRAPH>His French is suddenly really bad.<PARAGRAPH>Wait\u2026didn\u2019t he speak almost perfect French a few chapters ago? What\u2019s going on here?<PARAGRAPH>Madame Defarge stares at him curiously and asks if he\u2019s English.<PARAGRAPH>He says that he is.<PARAGRAPH>As she pours out the wine, he overhears her muttering to herself that he looks just like Evr\u00e9monde.<PARAGRAPH>Defarge enters the shop; he apparently thinks the same thing.<PARAGRAPH>He starts when he sees Carton at the counter, then walks over to confer with his wife.<PARAGRAPH>She and Jacques Three are discussing when the revolution will be over.<PARAGRAPH>Defarge notes that the violence will have to stop somewhere. The question, of course, is where.<PARAGRAPH>Madame Defarge has an answer to that: they\u2019ll stop when all of the aristocrats are exterminated.<PARAGRAPH>Defarge doesn\u2019t quite agree. After all, they all saw how Dr. Manette suffered when his son-in-law\u2019s verdict was read.<PARAGRAPH>Come to think of it, Madame Defarge is not so sure that Dr. Manette is a true patriot.<PARAGRAPH>Defarge says Dr. Manette\u2019s daughter, that sweet, innocent girl, was devastated by the trial today.<PARAGRAPH>Madame Defarge snaps at her husband. She\u2019s been watching Lucie.<PARAGRAPH>In fact, all she has to do is lift her finger...and Lucie\u2019s life would be over.<PARAGRAPH>Jacques Three thinks that Madame Defarge is magnificent.<PARAGRAPH>Apparently power (of any sort) always attracts followers.<PARAGRAPH>Madame Defarge goes on an angry tirade. As she says, she was with Defarge when he found Dr. Manette\u2019s letter.<PARAGRAPH>Moreover, she is the younger sister of the woman who was raped and kidnapped.<PARAGRAPH>She\u2019ll never stop pursuing her revenge against the Evr\u00e9mondes.<PARAGRAPH>Her listeners are fascinated by the deadly heat of her wrath. Even Defarge stops trying to talk her into being merciful.<PARAGRAPH>Sydney Carton listens to all of the conversation, then leaves.<PARAGRAPH>It\u2019s almost nine. He meets Mr. Lorry at his office.<PARAGRAPH>They wait until midnight, but Dr. Manette still doesn\u2019t return.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, he walks into the office.<PARAGRAPH>He\u2019s a broken man. He asks immediately where his workbench is: he\u2019s been looking for it all afternoon.<PARAGRAPH>Dismayed, Mr. Lorry rushes to help him.<PARAGRAPH>Carton agrees that Dr. Manette should be taken to Lucie. Before he lets them go, though, he tells Mr. Lorry about the conversation he overheard.<PARAGRAPH>Lucie and Dr. Manette are no longer safe in Paris.<PARAGRAPH>Quickly, Carton lays out his plans: Mr. Lorry will gather money and traveling papers for the Manettes.<PARAGRAPH>He should also arrange for a coach to take them to the border.<PARAGRAPH>Carton hands Mr. Lorry his own traveling papers. He says that Mr. Lorry should only wait until Carton\u2019s place in the coach is filled.<PARAGRAPH>As soon as that happens, the entire family must leave at once.<PARAGRAPH>He makes Mr. Lorry promise that they won\u2019t stop for any reason.<PARAGRAPH>Once Mr. Lorry promises, Carton goes out into the night.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210115212823/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/tale-of-two-cities/summary/volume-3-chapter-12"}
