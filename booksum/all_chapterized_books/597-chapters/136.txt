136. OF THORGEIR CRAGGEIR

Thorgeir Craggeir rode from the east with much people.  His
brothers were with him, Thorleif Crow and Thorgrim the Big.  They
came to Hof, to Mord Valgard's son's house, and bided there till
he was ready.  Mord had gathered every man who could bear arms,
and they could see nothing about him but that he was most
steadfast in everything, and now they rode until they came west
across the rivers.  Then they waited for Hjallti Skeggi's son.
He came after they had waited a short while, and they greeted him
well, and rode afterwards all together till they came to Reykia
in Bishop's tongue, and bided there for Asgrim Ellidagrim's son,
and he came to meet them there.  Then they rode west across
Bridgewater.  Then Asgrim told them all that had passed between
him and Flosi; and Thorgeir said, "I would that we might try
their bravery ere the Thing closes."

They rode until they came to Baitvale.  There Gizur the White
came to meet them with a very great company, and they fell to
talking together.  Then they rode to the Upper Field, and drew up
all their men in array there, and so rode to the Thing.

Flosi and his men all took to their arms, and it was within an
ace that they would fall to blows.  But Asgrim and his friends
and their followers would have no hand in it, and rode to their
booths; and now all was quiet that day, so that they had naught
to do with one another.  Thither were come chiefs from all the
Quarters of the land; there had never been such a crowded Thing
before, that men could call to mind.
