The sailor thinks he hears coins jingling in Marvel's pockets, though Marvel is clearly a moneyless tramp. The old man tells Marvel all about this amazing Invisible Man that he read about in the newspaper. This isn't some crazy hoax from America, but a story about something going on in England for realzies. The sailor thinks the story is believable because it comes equipped with names and details. He also thinks that an invisible man would make a great thief since no one could see or stop him. Marvel takes the opportunity to prove that he's kind of a dud: right before he tells the sailor that he knows the Invisible Man, he looks around. Does he expect to see the Invisible Man? In any case, the Invisible Man is there and starts hurting Marvel . Marvel quickly covers his tracks, saying that the Invisible Man is just a hoax. Then he gets out of there quickly . The sailor is annoyed at Marvel for letting him go on about this Invisible Man. But later, the sailor hears stories about a bunch of robberies and how people saw money just floating away. After that, he realizes what had gone down on the bench in Port Stowe, and just how close he had been to the Invisible Man.", "analysis": ""}
