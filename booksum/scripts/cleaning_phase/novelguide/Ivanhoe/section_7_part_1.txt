{"name": "Chapter XXV", "summary": "Chapter XXV. Front-de-Boeuf, De Bois-Guilbert and De Bracy meet. They have received a written demand from, of all people, Wamba and Gurth. The demand is that the knights surrender their prisoners within one hour or face the consequences. The document is also signed by the Black Knight. Locksley has placed his mark on it too. The knights do not know how to react. De Bracy laughs, but Front-de-Boeuf realizes how serious the ultimatum is. He knows there must be a strong force arrayed against them, and a squire confirms that at least two hundred men oppose them. But the knights are confident they have the means to hold the castle against the attackers. De Bois-Guilbert composes a reply to the challenge, which says that they will execute their prisoners before noon. The knights also request that a priest be sent to hear the last confessions of the prisoners. When the men in the forest get this message, they have to decide who to send as a priest. The Black Knight proposes Friar Tuck, but he refuses. Wamba then volunteers for the job", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210304062321/https://www.novelguide.com/ivanhoe/summaries/chapter25-28"}
