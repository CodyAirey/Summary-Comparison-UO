{"name": "Chapter 24", "summary": "This epigraph is a creepy one: \"I'll woo her as the lion woos his bride.\" This line comes from a play called <em>Douglas: A Tragedy</em> (1756) by Scottish writer John Home. The evil character Glenalvon plans to kidnap a married woman, Lady Randolph. In other words, it's a line about forcing a woman into a sexual relationship.<PARAGRAPH>In another part of the castle, Rebecca has been locked in a tower.<PARAGRAPH>There is an old woman in her cell, Urfried, who doesn't want to leave.<PARAGRAPH>Urfried hates Rebecca for her youth and beauty.<PARAGRAPH>She mocks Rebecca, telling her that the Normans won't kill her. She strongly implies that they'll rape her instead.<PARAGRAPH>Urfried leaves Rebecca to her fate.<PARAGRAPH>Rebecca looks around the room and sees no hope of escaping.<PARAGRAPH>She decides to stay as strong as she can, no matter what happens.<PARAGRAPH>A man appears at the door of her cell.<PARAGRAPH>He's dressed like one of the outlaws of the forest, with a cap half hiding his face.<PARAGRAPH>Rebecca offers him the ornaments she is wearing to ransom herself and her father.<PARAGRAPH>The outlaw refuses. He is not interested in money.<PARAGRAPH>The outlaw is none other than Brian de Bois-Guilbert. He wants Rebecca.<PARAGRAPH>Rebecca doesn't understand how a man sworn to fight on behalf of the cross (as a Knight Templar) can treat her this way.<PARAGRAPH>But Bois-Guilbert doesn't feel bad about breaking his vow of chastity.<PARAGRAPH>He has gone to the Holy Land to fight for the Temple of Solomon. After that, a small sin like sex is not going to damage his righteousness, he thinks.<PARAGRAPH>Rebecca swears to cross all of Europe and tell everyone that Bois-Guilbert raped her and broke his vows if he goes through with this.<PARAGRAPH>Bois-Guilbert worries about this potential loss of reputation.<PARAGRAPH>He demands that Rebecca convert to Christianity. Then he will keep her as a Norman lady.<PARAGRAPH>Rebecca defies Bois-Guilbert: how can she convert to Christianity when <em>he </em>is her example of what it means to be Christian?<PARAGRAPH>Rebecca runs to the window and stands ready to throw herself out.<PARAGRAPH>Bois-Guilbert feels bad and promises not to harm her. He is moved by her beauty and pride, and apologizes.<PARAGRAPH>Bois-Guilbert explains that heartbreak has made him this cruel.<PARAGRAPH>When he returned from the Crusades, having won fame and glory, he found that his ladylove had married an ordinary squire.<PARAGRAPH>Ever since, he has sworn to follow the solitary life of a Knight Templar.<PARAGRAPH>Bois-Guilbert hears the horn blowing at the gate.<PARAGRAPH>He asks Rebecca to think about what he has said.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210614173333/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/ivanhoe/summary/chapter-24"}
