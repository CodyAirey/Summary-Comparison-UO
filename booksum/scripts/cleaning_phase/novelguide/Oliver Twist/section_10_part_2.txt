{"name": "Chapter 32", "summary": "PARAGRAPH>Chapter 32: Oliver caught a fever, but under the good care of his new friends, he recovered. He offered to work for the family if they would let him stay and they assented easily. When Oliver was recovered, Dr. Losberne took him to the residence of Mr. Brownlow who Oliver wanted to see so he could tell them what happened. On the way, Oliver spotted the house that Sikes had taken him to the night of the robbery, and they stopped so that Dr. Losberne could question the owner. This questioning proved inconclusive. When they arrived at the Brownlow residence however, they found that Mr. Brownlow, Mrs. Bedwin, and Mr. Grimwig had all moved to the West Indies. Oliver, saddened by the news, went back to stay with Mrs. Maylie. Soon the whole family moved out to the cottage in the country and Oliver was extremely happy there. He learned all he could from the village vicar, and would take daily walks with Mrs. Maylie and Rose whom he adored", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201020210431/https://www.novelguide.com/oliver-twist/summaries/chap31-chap33"}
