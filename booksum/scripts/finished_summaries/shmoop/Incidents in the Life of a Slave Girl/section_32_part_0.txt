When Linda's limbs become swollen from walking up and down the stairs taking care of the baby, Mrs. Bruce gets her a doctor and lightens her work load. Since the Hobbses are not clothing Ellen, Linda uses her wages to buy Ellen clothes. Mrs. Bruce is a really nice lady, and Linda is almost happy. She loves Mrs. Bruce's little baby, because it reminds her of her own little ones. One day, looking out the window, Linda sees a handsome young sailor out the window. It's totally her brother! She runs downstairs, and they hug and laugh and cry.", "analysis": ""}
