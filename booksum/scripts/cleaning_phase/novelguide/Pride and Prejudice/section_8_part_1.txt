{"name": "volume 2, Chapter 33", "summary": "Chapter 33: More than once Elizabeth has unexpectedly met Mr. Darcy in the park. She has told him that she often walks there, so she does not understand why he continues to go there. While she is walking this time though, she meets Colonel Fitzwilliam. They begin to walk and converse, and when the subject of Miss Darcy arises, Fitzwilliam tells Elizabeth that he is joined in the guardianship of her with Darcy. When Elizabeth asks if such a young lady is difficult to manage, Fitzwilliam looks at her earnestly, and Elizabeth thinks that she had somehow got near the truth. The conversation turns to Darcy's friendship with Bingley, and Fitzwilliam tells Elizabeth that it seems that Bingley is in debt to Darcy for getting him out of an imprudent marriage. While he says that he is not sure it is Bingley, he says that he understands that there were \"some very strong objections against the lady,\" and Darcy congratulates himself on getting Bingley away from her. Elizabeth is quite sure that Fitzwilliam is speaking of Jane and Bingley, as she cannot believe that Darcy could have so much influence over two men. When she is again at home, her agitation and tears bring on a headache, and she does not join the others for a visit to Lady Catherine's", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201020001144/https://www.novelguide.com/pride-and-prejudice/summaries/chap33-36"}
