Linda freezes in the winter and soaks during the spring. During the second winter, a long illness almost kills her. Her brother William manages to get medicine from a doctor by pretending that her symptoms are his. She also sees her son covered in blood from a dog bite. He's fine, but it's a long time before he can walk. Mrs. Flint shows off her Christian charity by gloating and wishing that Benny had actually died. Meanwhile, Aunt Martha is very sick, too. She recovers, but it's close. This chapter is pretty grim.", "analysis": ""}
