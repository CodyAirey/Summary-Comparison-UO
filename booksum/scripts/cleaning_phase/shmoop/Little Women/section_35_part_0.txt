{"name": "Chapter 36", "summary": "When Jo comes home from New York, she is shocked by how much sicker Beth seems.<PARAGRAPH>At first Jo forgets about Beth's illness because she's caught up with Laurie's proposal, but after Laurie leaves she notices again.<PARAGRAPH>Jo takes Beth on a trip to the seashore, hoping the nice weather and the sea air will help her get better. This was a pretty common nineteenth-century idea - people often went to the coast or to a warmer climate when they were sick.<PARAGRAPH>Jo and Beth spend several weeks at the seaside together. Jo takes care of Beth, and the sisters ignore the outside world.<PARAGRAPH>Jo wonders how her parents haven't noticed that Beth seems to be dying. She hopes they'll notice for themselves when she and Beth return home.<PARAGRAPH>One day, Beth begins to talk to Jo about it. She figures out that Jo has realized she's dying, and says she's glad Jo knows.<PARAGRAPH>As the sisters talk about Beth's death, Jo realizes that Beth was never lovesick for Laurie - she was just grieving because she discovered that she was dying. Beth says that she's reconciled herself to it.<PARAGRAPH>Jo insists that Beth can get well and says that nineteen is too young to die. Beth, however, is convinced that she is dying and just focuses on her faith.<PARAGRAPH>Beth makes Jo promise to tell their parents about her condition. Jo does.<PARAGRAPH>Beth tells Jo that she thinks she wasn't meant to live for very long. She never had dreams of getting married or doing something ambitious with her life.<PARAGRAPH>Beth watches the birds outside her window. She uses the birds as a metaphor for herself and her sisters - she is like a peep, a docile bird that stays near the shore and sings, just the way she likes to stay at home and take care of the family. Beth thinks that Jo is like a gull, strong and wild, Meg a turtledove, the symbol of a lover, and Amy a lark, flying high but also returning to the nest. We think this novel is like an extra spoonful of sugar in a jar of honey - a little too much.<PARAGRAPH>Jo promises to help make Beth's last days happy and gives her sister a kiss.<PARAGRAPH>When Jo and Beth return home, their parents realize that Beth is dying. Jo comforts them without words.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210225041510/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/little-women/summary/chapter-36"}
