{"name": "Chapters 32-34", "summary": "The liberated party assemble at Locksley's trysting place in the forest, where Cedric makes Gurth a free man. Cedric refuses a share of the plunder from the castle, but both he and Rowena express gratitude for Locksley's help.\nFriar Tuck arrives, leading Isaac by a rope around his neck. The Friar and the Black Knight engage in friendly fisticuffs to decide the fate of the Jew. The Jew and the Prior set each other's ransom and Isaac learns of Rebecca's abduction. For a price the Prior offers to use his influence with Brian de Bois-Guilbert and furnishes a letter to this effect. The Saxon party leaves with the body of Athelstane to prepare the funeral rites at Coningsburgh Castle, Athelstane's home.\nDe Bracy, set free by the Black Knight, announces to Prince John that Richard is in England, that Bois-Guilbert has fled, and that Front-de-Boeuf is dead. When he recovers from the shock, Prince John conceives a plot to make his brother prisoner and Fitzurse sets out to do his bidding.", "analysis": "In character, quote, or scene, Shakespeare was often present with Scott. Note the similarity between Isaac and Shylock of The Merchant of Venice. The forest scene of this chapter is reminiscent of A Midsummer Night's Dream. The robber band often has impish or elfin qualities, and further distinctions of a supernatural nature are introduced by references to \"the Devil that is in his jerkin\" and \"mortal Men\" .\nThat King Richard would stoop to an exchange of blows with the Friar is not unlikely. He was supposed to have had such an encounter when he was a prisoner in Germany. According to the story his antagonist was a warder's son. Richard received a hard blow and returned one with such force that he killed his adversary.\nThe complicated finagling about setting the ransom of the Prior and Isaac is included for the sake of its humor. A Jew is pitted against a churchman and a comic priest against a corrupt one. The outlaw mediator is the only one who shows principle. The equity with which Locksley divides the spoil illustrates the adage \"honor among thieves.\"\nDistrust and intrigue in officialdom is an old story. At the time of which Scott writes it often initiated a change of loyalty as a matter of saving one's own neck.\nGlossary\nAldhelm of a scholar and church-builder of the seventh\nMalmsbury century\ntheow and esne thrall and bondsman\nlevin-fire lightning\nquondam having been formerly; former; sometime\nmanus imponere servos Domini in to lay hands on the servant of the Lord\nExcommunicabo vos.
