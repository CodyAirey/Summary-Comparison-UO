Harold Skimpole reveals that Coavinses , the man who frequently arrested him for debt, has died. Mr. Jarndyce, Esther, and Ada go to Neckett's lodgings and find that the man left three destitute children -- Charlotte , Tom, and eighteen-month-old Emma. Mr. Gridley , a bitter, truculent \"man from Shropshire,\" is surprisingly kind and helpful to Neckett's children. He tells Mr. Jarndyce and his wards the cause of his bitterness: The delay of the Chancery Court has destroyed the inheritance that belonged to him and his brother.", "analysis": "Harold Skimpole and the Chancery Court have something important in common: Both seem unreal in attitude and both are quite irresponsible. Through the figure of Gridley, Dickens strengthens his criticism of Chancery. The unmerited and pathetic suffering of children, a recurring theme in much of Dickens' fiction, is portrayed again in the children made orphans by Neckett's death."}
