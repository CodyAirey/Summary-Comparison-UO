This is in contrast to the future that the Defarges look forward to which is one of vengeance and violence.<PARAGRAPH>The Doctor is fortunate that he has overcome the need for revenge thanks to the care he has received from Lucie.<PARAGRAPH>The reader cannot be content in the Manettes' happiness because we know that the Defarges have identified Darnay and have vowed to destroy the entire Evremonde line including any children that result from Lucie and Darnay's marriage.<PARAGRAPH>A Tale of Two Cities differs from the other novels of Dickens in respect that the characters lack depth and complexity with the exception of Dr. Manette. The passage describing his conversation with Mr. Lorry in Chapter 19 reveals the diversity of Manette's character ranging from a doting father, to a capable professional, to a vulnerable victim. He seems convinced that he is over the relapses and this is confirmed by his agreement for the bench and tools to be disposed of, these being the symbols of the refuge he would go to in order to escape reality in prison."}
