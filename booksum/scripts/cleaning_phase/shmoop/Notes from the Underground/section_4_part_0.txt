{"name": "Part 1, Chapter 5", "summary": "Glad you asked! Once again, the question is, can a man who is hyper-conscious, who takes pleasure in his own degradation, possibly respect himself?<PARAGRAPH>Before answering this question, the Underground Man assures us that he is not asking this out of remorse. In fact, he has never been one to ask for forgiveness at all, not because he's not capable, but because he's too capable. <PARAGRAPH>So what he used to do, say, when he was a child, was shed tears and feel genuinely guilty - for a minute or two. But then he would stop and curse himself and realize that his feelings of remorse were all a lie.<PARAGRAPH>Why, we may be inclined to ask, did the Underground Man do such a thing? To amuse himself, he explains. Because \"sitting with one's hands folded\" is an incredibly boring task.<PARAGRAPH>His solution was to \"invent adventures\" for himself, to make up a life so he could live it.<PARAGRAPH>For example, he could pretend to take offense at someone. If you pretend long enough, you really DO take offense.<PARAGRAPH>For a second example, he could pretend to be in love. He tried very hard, he says - twice - to be in love. He even suffered, though he could tell his heart was mocking his own suffering.<PARAGRAPH>And what drove him to pretend this way? Ennui  and inertia .<PARAGRAPH>What about the people who do manage to live genuine lives? The Underground Man says that these \"men of action\" are only able to function because...they're stupid. He says they take secondary causes to be primary ones, and this allows them to establish a basis for their actions.<PARAGRAPH><PARAGRAPH>Because to begin to act at all, he explains, you have to remove all doubt from your mind. <PARAGRAPH>The problem with the Underground Man is that every time he tries to find a primary cause for his actions, he finds some other motive lurking behind it, and yet another, continuing on ad infinitum, which means no cause he identifies is actually primary and therefore can't be used as a basis for action. <PARAGRAPH>The Underground Man says that, since he can't act based on primary causes, maybe he could act on spite. Unfortunately, as you remember from Chapter One, he's not even spiteful. He only lies about his being spiteful. In short: he's screwed. He can't act, at all, ever.<PARAGRAPH>If he does try to act as a \"normal, stupid man\" does, by not over-analyzing and simply doing, he ends up hating himself later, knowing that his action rose out of self-deception.<PARAGRAPH>In fact, the reason he knows he's so intelligent is the fact that, for his whole life, he has never been able to start or finish anything.<PARAGRAPH>He then asks \"what is to be done\" if the only real occupation for an intelligent man is this sort of babbling.<PARAGRAPH>Good question. Also, keep a look out for the phrase \"what is to be done\"; it's probably a veiled nod to Nikolai Chernyshevsky's novel, What Is to Be Done?, to which Dostoevsky will refer later when he talks about a \"Crystal Palace.\" But hold your horses, we'll get there.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210227100412/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/notes-from-underground/summary/part-1-chapter-5"}
