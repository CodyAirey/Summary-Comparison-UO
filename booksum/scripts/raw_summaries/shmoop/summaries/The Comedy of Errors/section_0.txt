{"name": "Act I, Scene i", "summary": "Our comedy begins at the Ephesian marketplace, where Solinas, the Duke of Ephesus, is explaining why poor Egeon, a merchant of\u00a0Syracuse, must die. (Yes, this is a comedy.)<PARAGRAPH>Solinus says that merchants from Ephesus have been forbidden to enter Syracuse, and merchants from Syracuse have been forbidden to enter Ephesus. The punishment for disobeying? Death, of course. It's harsh, yes, but Solinas wants everyone to know that the Duke of Syracuse started it.<PARAGRAPH>Of course, there\u2019s a monetary loophole.\u00a0Egeon\u00a0can\u00a0get out of the death sentence by paying a thousand marks. But Duke Solinus comments that Egeon doesn't appear to be worth even 100 marks. Way to kick him when he's down, Solinus.<PARAGRAPH>To the Duke's surprise, Egeon says he finds the idea of death comforting. This piques Duke Solinus\u2019s curiosity, so he asks how and why Egeon left Syracuse for Ephesus.<PARAGRAPH>Egeon declares his grief to be unspeakable, and then immediately begins to talk about it. Egeon wants to clear up that he does not want to die because of some heinous crime he\u2019s committed. Rather, his death wish is kind of a natural result of grief, which he\u2019s had a lot of in his life. He\u2019ll even tell you about it, in great length and detail.<PARAGRAPH>Egeon was born in Syracuse, and lived comfortably there with his wife. He made a lot of money traveling between Syracuse and Epidamium as a merchant. When his agent died, he had to stay in Epidamium and take care of business himself. Egeon\u2019s wife, who was pregnant at the time, decided to join him.<PARAGRAPH>Egeon\u2019s wife soon gave birth to identical twin boys, who looked so similar that their names were their only distinguishing feature. As literary devices would have it, a poor woman staying at the very same inn, during the very same hour, happened to also give birth to identical twin boys. Because she was too poor to raise the babies, she sold her children to Egeon, who wanted to raise the boys as companions and attendants for his twin boys.<PARAGRAPH>Egeon\u2019s wife then started to nag him, saying they should all go home. But, as soon as the family got on the ship to head back to Syracuse, a terrible storm rolls in, threatening to kill everyone. The wife and babes wept, the sailors abandoned ship and ran off in Egeon\u2019s lifeboat, and it seemed that nothing could save them.<PARAGRAPH>Egeon\u2019s wife, worried for the younger of the twins, tied him and one of the servant twins to a small spare mast. Egeon did the same with the other two older boys. Then, Egeon and his wife guarded either end of the mast, each with their respective pair of babies (one son and one servant kid for each parent). When the storm started to calm, the family saw two ships approach\u2014one from Corinth, the other from Epidaurus.<PARAGRAPH>To make the situation even more of a logic puzzle, Egeon\u2019s boat ran into a big rock. The boat was torn in two, separating the two parents (with their respective pair of separated twins). The wife and two babies were rescued by the Corinthian ship, while Egeon and his two boys were picked up by the other. Sadly, the ship that Egeon was in was slow, and headed for home instead of catching up with the ship from Corinth. Thus, Egeon never saw his wife, younger twin son, or his servant ever again.<PARAGRAPH>Egeon explains to the Duke that when his son and servant turned eighteen, they got itchy to find their long lost twin brothers, and left Egeon alone. (Note that, thinking the other boys were gone, Egeon gave his son and the servant the names of their missing brothers, which will ensure some hilarity later on.)<PARAGRAPH>Egeon\u2019s son and servant have been gone for five summers, in which time Egeon has roamed around the farthest reaches of Asia trying to find both lost sets of boys. His travels finally brought him to Ephesus. He knows that he risks death by entering Ephesus, but would rather risk death than not look for the boys here. Thus he\u2019s lost a wife and two sets of kids, but has acquired a loneliness that\u2019s priceless.<PARAGRAPH>The Duke basically says to him, \"I can\u2019t bend the rules, so you\u2019re still sentenced to die.\" Still, he gives Egeon one day to try to raise the 1,000 marks for his bail by begging and borrowing from the folks of Ephesus. Duke Solinus then sends a fairly hopeless Egeon off with the jailer.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210514044103/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/comedy-of-errors/summary/act-i-scene-i"}
