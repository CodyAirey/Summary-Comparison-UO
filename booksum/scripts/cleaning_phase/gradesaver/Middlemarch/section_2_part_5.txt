{"name": "book 3, Chapter 27", "summary": "PARAGRAPH>Chapter 27:<PARAGRAPH>Summary:<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Vincy becomes completely consumed by Fred and his illness, to an unhealthy extent; Lydgate is around the house frequently, and sees a good bit of Rosamond as well. Lydgate's attentions to Rosamond are causing some resentment in the neighborhood, as rivals for her affection become jealous of him; Rosamond continues to believe that Lydgate is in love with her and intends marriage, while Lydgate merely enjoys her pleasant company. At the end of the chapter, Lydgate receives a summons from Sir James Chettam, who he has not attended to before. PARAGRAPH>Analysis:<PARAGRAPH>Eliot's extended metaphor of Rosamond's luck to scratches in a pier-glass is an apt one; Rosamond does believe herself to be lucky and served by fate, and events do seem to happen by chance that further her designs. It is another good thing that Rosamond recognizes a good chance when she happens upon it, and so takes advantage of the opportunity to become closer to Lydgate. Rosamond, for all her flaws, is a very canny girl, and able to use situations to her benefit. PARAGRAPH>The vanity of Middlemarch men becomes apparent, as they all begin to resent Lydgate for gaining Rosamond's attentions. They prefer to blame Lydgate, though it is Rosamond who is responsible, and they are loathe to admit that maybe she just isn't interested in them. Skins are rather thin in Middlemarch, and it seems that people try hard to blame other people, rather than to realize a truth that might hurt them. PARAGRAPH>Unfortunately for Lydgate, not only is he making enemies, but he is failing in his attempts to get close to Rosamond, yet keep marriage at a distance. Eliot compares the plight of Lydgate's plan to a \"jellyfish which gets melted without knowing it\"; the metaphor reinforces the danger that Lydgate is in, of being pushed into a relationship which he is in no way ready for", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210125120143/https://www.gradesaver.com/middlemarch/study-guide/summary-chapters-23-33"}
