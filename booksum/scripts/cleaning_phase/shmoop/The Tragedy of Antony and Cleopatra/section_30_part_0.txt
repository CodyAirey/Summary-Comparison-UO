{"name": "Act IV, Scene vi", "summary": "On Caesar's side of the battle, we find Caesar confident that he will be victorious.<PARAGRAPH>He instructs his men of the following: he wants Antony taken alive, and he announces that the end of this battle  will bring a time of universal peace.<PARAGRAPH>Caesar instructs Agrippa to put the defectors from Antony's army on the front line--he hopes Antony's morale will be hurt by having to face his own deserting men.<PARAGRAPH>All head out for some more planning, leaving Enobarbus by himself. He notes privately that Caesar has a strange sense of justice; Alexas, on an errand for Antony, ended up persuading King Herod to join Caesar's side , but regardless, Caesar had Alexas killed for it. Other cases are clearer: all the others who have deserted Antony have gained employment with Caesar, but lost their honor in doing so.<PARAGRAPH>Just as Enobarbus is deciding to be really ashamed of himself for his desertion, one of Caesar's soldier's announces the arrival of a messenger from Antony. The man bears Antony's good tidings to Enobarbus and the treasure Enobarbus left behind, plus a little more that Antony added on.<PARAGRAPH>Enobarbus is shocked and now even more ashamed of his desertion. He's sure his thoughts will kill him, as he certainly can't bear to fight against Antony.<PARAGRAPH>He hopes to die in a ditch, which he imagines is the only end fitting the miserable lowness of his recent actions.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210116191009/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/antony-cleopatra/summary/act-iv-scene-vi"}
