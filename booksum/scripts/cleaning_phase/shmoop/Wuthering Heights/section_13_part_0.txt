Heathcliff, however, \"never looked better\" .<PARAGRAPH>Nelly tells Isabella that Edgar will not be contacting her. She tells Heathcliff that Catherine is recovering from her illness and that he should let her be. He, of course, won't stand for that, and Nelly warns him, \"Another encounter between you and the master would kill her altogether!\" .<PARAGRAPH>Heathcliff rants about how great Catherine's love is for him, compared to her love for Edgar.

She now knows better, but she still loves him no matter how vile he is. \"No brutality disgusted her\", he tells Nelly.<PARAGRAPH>Heathcliff forces Nelly to arrange a meeting with Catherine.
