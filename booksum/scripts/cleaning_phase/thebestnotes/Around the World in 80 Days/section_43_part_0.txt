{"name": "themes - theme analysis", "summary": "The journey around the world in the challenged eighty days   - This is the main theme of the novel and connected to it, is \nthe main character, the hero of the story. Phileas Fogg is challenged by fellow \nwhist players as to whether he can complete a journey around the world in the \nshort span of eighty days. Fogg is extremely excited to take up this challenge, \nas he believes that if one is precise and efficient enough can make this journey \npossible. So he takes up the task and starts a hurried journey around the world. \nHe has many ups and downs in this strenuous journey but he has a never say die \nattitude that sees him through. Entwined with the story of his travels is the \none character who proves to be an obstacle once too often. He is the detective \nFix and he suspects that, Fogg is a bank robber and that the hurried travel from \none place to another is just a means of covering up the crime. So apart from natural \nhurdles and obstacles that Fogg has to face, he has the further machinations of \ndetective Fix to circumvent. What is surprising is that Fogg does not suspect \nFix and never smells a rat. In fact, Fogg helps Fix at more than one occasion.<PARAGRAPH>During the journey the focus of the author remains Fogg, his companions \nand their experiences. While the places that they pass through are described briefly \nthey are not given any outstanding reference. They just form the background to \nthe activities of the hero Fogg with his insurmountable, incorrigible will.<PARAGRAPH>The other minor themes in the novel too are entwined with this major theme of \nthe travels around the world. The fact is that Fogg finds the love of his life-Aouda \nonly because of this trip. At the end, Verne seems to be putting across a moral \nlesson-that challenges are not as important as finding true, abiding love and \naffection. Verne says that the heroic Fogg would not have attained as much from \nworldly accomplishments, as he does from finding lasting love with the charming \nAouda.<PARAGRAPH>Fogg does win the challenge but only after an interesting episode. \nHe himself thinks that he has reached a little late and has lost. But he and his \ngroup are unaware that they have actually reached a whole day earlier. Fortunately \nfor them, even after they have given up, by a stroke of luck Fogg, Passepartout \nand Aouda find out that they still have a few minutes to reach the Reform Club \nand Fogg does! We are all glad that Fogg is the winner at the end.<PARAGRAPH>The \nsuspicion that Fogg might be the bank robber  - Verne is an intelligent \nwriter, who must have known how to sustain the reader's interest. Knowing that \nFogg's hurried journey around the world would not be interesting enough without \nentwined sub themes Verne adds a couple of sub themes, a few being Passepartout's \nbuffoonery, Aouda's love and Fix's suspicion that Fogg is a bank robber. The narrator \nrelates how a well-dressed gentleman was responsible for a huge robbery at the \nBank of England. If we combine that fact with the knowledge of Fogg's eccentricities, \neven we as readers get a little curious as to whether Fogg could be a robber. \nAfter all Fogg could have readily accepted the challenge merely because it gave \nhim a chance to flee London and to set out on a wild journey that would make him \nuntraceable. This suspicion keeps us interested too, though we do realize that \nFogg is an honorable man and would not commit such an attack. What Verne does \nmanage to do is to create a mysterious aura around Fogg. We learn that he has \nbeen a sailor too in the way that he handles the ship to Liverpool.<PARAGRAPH>Fix \nfollows Fogg through the world after being completely convinced that the latter \nis the culprit. It is Fix who delays the journey innumerable times. These delays \nare challenges to Fogg who deals with them brilliantly, adding further interest \nvalue to the narrative.<PARAGRAPH>When Fix finally manages to arrest Fogg he finds \nout that his conviction was completely wrong. Fogg is innocent and is so angry \nthat he gives Fix an amazing blow on his face. Later, Fogg feels sorry for Fix's \nunfortunate luck and gives him some money. The manner in which Fogg deals with \nFix is truly gentleman like.<PARAGRAPH>Fogg's development of character  - Fogg is the intelligent and precise man who is particular about times \nand habits, to the extent of being eccentric. He likes his shaving water at a \nparticular temperature and he follows a strict routine every day, without fail. \nInitially, he comes across as completely unemotional and pragmatic. He seems incapable \nof love, though he does always seem large hearted. Throughout the journey his \nsole focus is to jump from train to ship and ship to train, in order to complete \nhis travel around the world. In his spare time, he plays whist instead of sight \nseeing. And while these qualities might make him seem completely heartless, he \nis not.<PARAGRAPH>It is he who suggests that their group try and save the Indian \nprincess. After they are successful, Aouda is extreme in her gratitude and eventually \nfalls in love with him. For a long time, he continues to be undemonstrative and \nunresponsive. Aouda is not sure of his affections for her. It is only in London \nthat he confesses his love for her and they decide to marry. Verne highlights \nthat winning the challenge is not as important for Fogg as to win the love of \nAouda. The last statement of Fogg truly reflects the change in this practical \nman's view of life. He tells Passepartout that they might have gone round the \nworld in seventy eight days but adds further that, \"But if I had not gone \nthrough India I should not have saved Aouda, she would not have been my wife and \nafter saying this he closes the door. It is obvious that he is very happy with \nAouda and the development in his character is that his heart is now overflowing \nwith love, much more than before. Even Verne adds that after Fogg's long travels, \nthe only thing that he had gained was \"...a charming woman, who unlikely \nas it is may appear, made him the happiest of men! And forsooth, who would not \ngo round the world for less?\" Fogg's development in character is a positive \none and one that can only be brought about by love.<PARAGRAPH>Passepartout's comic behavior  - Verne \nhas provided for comic relief in this novel of adventure and one of the sources \nis Passepartout. He is Fogg's valet and is quite the opposite of his precise master. \nPassepartout tends towards carelessness and is funny at many occasions. He gets \nhis master into trouble often because of his casualness. When he walks into a \npagoda at Malabar Hill with his shoes on he commits a serious crime and is sued \nby the Indian priests later.<PARAGRAPH>Fogg gets intoxicated with opium and is unable \nto inform his master that their ship would be leaving early. Fogg misses this \nparticular ship as a result. Then, in Yokohama Passepartout takes up work as a \nJapanese longnose entertainer. He has the bohemian, wild blood that makes him \na nomad who has visited many countries. It is for rest and stability sake that \nhe joins Fogg as valet, little knowing that his master will take up a fast paced \njourney around the world.<PARAGRAPH>Passepartout is also brave. It is his unique \nidea at the end that saves Aouda and he fights the Sioux bravely. On the whole, \nhe is loyal to his master and is the provider of much needed lighthearted moments.<PARAGRAPH>In fact after Fogg, \nit is only Passepartout's character that is given so much attention. Passepartout \nbecomes close and dear to the reader, as much as he is to Fogg and Aouda. The \nonly thing that we might grudge against him is that trusts Fix for too long and \nshould have taken up some action against him.<PARAGRAPH>Fogg and Aouda's \nlove  - When Fogg and his group are traveling through India, they \ncome across a princess, who is being forced to commit 'suttee'  for the \nsake of her dead husband. It is quite uncharacteristic of Fogg to get involved \nin others' affairs but he reiterates that he has some time to spare, which can \nbe used in an effort to save the princess Aouda. The others agree to Fogg's idea \nand it is Passepartout who comes up with the winning trick that makes their effort \nsuccessful. When Aouda comes to her senses, after the effect of opium has worn \naway she expresses her extreme gratefulness to her saviors. But the reader notices \nlater that Aouda's gratitude is combined with deep affection in the case of Fogg. \nShe starts loving him for his nobility and his courage. Moreover, he is a handsome \nman. While Fogg takes utmost care of Aouda one does not know whether it is out \nof love, or merely for duty's sake. He is extremely careful with her and is concerned \nabout her safety. Passepartout can recognize Aouda's affection for Fogg but he \ntoo is not sure whether Fogg would reciprocate. The fact is that Fogg does have \nfeelings for Aouda but he places his duty above his love.<PARAGRAPH>It is only at \nthe end of their journey, at London that he confesses his love for her and they \ndecide to get married. It is their decision to marry that enables Fogg to win \nthe bet. For it is through the priest that they learn that they had actually reached \nLondon a whole day earlier. Fogg rushes to the Reform Club and is just in time \nfor winning the challenge. Later, Verne underlines the fact that attaining Aouda's \nlove was more important than winning a challenge.<PARAGRAPH>The sub theme of Fogg \nand Aouda's love adds romantic interest to the story. And, we learn the lesson \nthat love conquers all and that it must be placed higher than material attainments.<PARAGRAPH>Various bets on Fogg's journey around the world  - The challenge between the whist players and Fogg captures the imagination of English \nfolk. The report of the wager was first circulated among the members of the Reform \nClub. The excitement then passed from the club to the papers through the reporters \nand papers communicated it to London and the whole of the United Kingdom. This \n'question of a journey around the world' was commented, discussed, analyzed as \nkeenly and passionately as if it had been a case of a new Alabama Claim. Some \nsided with Fogg but the great majority, declared against him.<PARAGRAPH>A great \nmany articles were written about this topic and they in turn influenced the performance \nof Fogg shares. During the first days after the gentleman's departure, important \ntransactions were started on the chances of his enterprise. The English betters \nwere a cleverer class than gamblers. Apart from Reform Club members, a great majority \nof the public joined in. Fogg was registered in a sort of studbook like a racehorse. \nHe was also converted into stock, which was at once quoted on 'Change. 'Fogg' \nwas asked for and offered at par or at a premium and enormous business was done. \nBut five days after his departure, after the publication of the article in the \nRoyal Geographical Society' Report 'Fogg' scrip declined. It was offered in bundles. \nAt first people accepted five to one, then ten and then not less than twenty fifty, \na hundred. One single supporter remained faithful to him: an old paralytic, Lord \nAlbermale. Transactions began to dwindle away and they only revived when the suspicion \nthat Fogg was a robber was cleared.<PARAGRAPH>When the real thief was arrested all \nthose who had made bets for or against him and had already forgotten the case \ncame forward again as if by magic. All the old transactions became valid again \nall engagements binding and it should be said that the people's revived keenness \nresulted in many a new bet. Fogg's name was again at a premium on 'Change. Betting \nagain took place on a larger scale than before.<PARAGRAPH>This sub theme of the \nbets on Fogg adds a realistic touch to the story. After all, England is and was \na gambler's paradise. And Fogg's challenge was such as to inspire the interest \nof many.<PARAGRAPH>Depiction of places that Fogg passes through  - No story can be narrated without a fitting background. In this story, the \nbackground involves the entire world and the author has used it brilliantly without \noveremphasizing it. While the focus of the narrative remains Fogg's attempt to \ncomplete the journey around the world, Verne manages to describe the places that \nthe former passes through in a short and eloquent manner. He describes the places \nwithout digging into details and that is what maintains our interest. We manage \nto understand the essence of each location that Fogg passes through-be it-Suez, \nBombay, Calcutta, Hong Kong, Yokohama, San Francisco, New York or Liverpool. Indeed, \nVerne must have widely traveled as well as read, himself to be able to describe \nso many places truthfully. Verne does tell us how Fogg is not interested in sightseeing \nand would rather play whist. At the same time, he knows a lot about each place \nand we suspect that he had been a sailor before he got down to settling in London. \nFogg too shares the same mysterious envelope that Captain Nemo, another of Verne's \ncharacters had.<PARAGRAPH>The manner in which Verne describes these places is very \ndelicately entwined with the hero's actions and experiences. Verne inserts these \nbeautifully worded paragraphs amidst narrative details, so they do not impose \non story but seem to be an integral part of the plot.<PARAGRAPH>Without the description \nof these places, the book would have been incomplete. Through them, the reader \ngets the impression of an epic like quality.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141554/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Around_The_World_In_80_Days/Around_The_World_In_Eighty_Days38.html"}
