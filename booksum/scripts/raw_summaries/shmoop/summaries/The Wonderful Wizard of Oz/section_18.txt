The Scarecrow tries to enter under the branches of a big tree, but the tree wallops him good.<PARAGRAPH>Even so, the Scarecrow's fine. (Sometimes it pays to be made out of straw.) He tries to pass under another tree and gets tossed again. Dang, these trees are violent!<PARAGRAPH>The Tin Woodman goes back to the first tree that assaulted the Scarecrow and gives it a good hack with his axe. Everyone's able to pass into the forest without further ado. It was just that first line of trees that was the problem.<PARAGRAPH>When they emerge from the woods, they come to a tall, smooth wall.
