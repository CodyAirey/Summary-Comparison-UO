{"name": "chapter 8", "summary": "Fix soon rejoined Passepartout, who was lounging and looking about \non the quay. Fix gets Passepartout talking. Passepartout admits that his master \nand he have been journeying at a frantic pace and that he never gets a chance \nto sightsee. Fix offers to take Passepartout to the right shops for shoe and shirt \nshopping. They go off together and Fix points out that Passepartout's watch is \nslow. The valet replies that his watch is a family watch, come down from the time \nof his great-grandfather and that it doesn't vary five minutes in the year. To \nthis Fix points out that he had kept London time, which was two hours behind that \nof Suez. He then advises him to regulate his watch at noon in each country. Passepartout \nrefuses to regulate his watch and returns the watch to its fob with a defiant \ngesture.<PARAGRAPH>After a few minutes silence, Fix resumes the conversation and \nlearns that Fogg was making a journey round the world and that he was a rich man. \nHe also gets to know that Passepartout did not believe that his master was merely \nmaking such a journey for the sake of a bet. The effect of these replies upon \nthe already suspicious and excited detective may be imagined. The hasty departure \nfrom London soon after the robbery; the large sum carried by Mr. Fogg; his eagerness \nto reach distant countries; the pretext of an eccentric and foolhardy bet all \nconfirmed Fix in his theory. He continues to pump poor Passepartout, and learns \nthat he really knew little or nothing of his master, who lived a solitary existence \nin London, was said to be rich, though no one knew whence came his riches, and \nwas mysterious and impenetrable in his affairs and habits. Fix felt sure that \nPhileas Fogg would not land at Suez, but was really going on to Bombay.<PARAGRAPH>When Passepartout spoke to Fix about the gas burner that was burning at his expense, \nFix didn't pay any attention to Passepartout's trouble about the gas. He was not \nlistening, but was cogitating a project. Passepartout and he had now reached the \nshop, where Fix left his companion to make his purchases, after recommending him \nnot to miss the steamer, and hurried back to the consulate. Now that he was fully \nconvinced, Fix had quite recovered his equanimity.<PARAGRAPH>Fix tries to persuade \nthe Consul that he has found the robber. He reports in a few words the most important \nparts of his conversation with Passepartout. He then proceeds to the telegraph \noffice, from where he sends the dispatch, which we have seen, to the London police \noffice. A quarter of an hour later Fix, with a small bag in his hand, advances \non board the Mongolia; and the noble steamer rides out at full steam upon the \nwaters of the Red Sea.<PARAGRAPH>Notes\nFix as we have seen \nis a shrewd detective who gets his information by snooping around. Now, he approaches \nPassepartout with the sole intention of obtaining information regarding Fogg. \nDetective Fix manages to divulge a lot of information from Passepartout regarding \nhis master Fogg. We wonder why Passepartout reveals information so readily and \neasily. We see that Passepartout is a simpleton and loves to talk. He easily trusts \npeople and it is only much later, that he realizes the truth about Fix.<PARAGRAPH>Fix continues the probing - \"You are in a great hurry, \nthen?\" \"I am not, but my master is. By the way, I must buy some shoes \nand shirts. We came away without trunks, only with a carpetbag.\" \"I \nwill show you an excellent shop for getting what you want.\"<PARAGRAPH>\"Really, \nmonsieur, you are very kind.\"<PARAGRAPH>And they walked off together, Passepartout \nchatting volubly as they went along. \"Above all,\" said he; \"don't \nlet me lose the steamer.\"<PARAGRAPH>\"You have plenty of time; it's only \ntwelve o'clock.\" Passepartout pulled out his big watch. \"Twelve!\" \nhe exclaimed; \"why, it's only eight minutes before ten.\" \"Your \nwatch is slow.\" Passepartout is a loveable simpleton. When he is told to \nregulate his watch, his pride prevents him from doing so. He says - \"I regulate \nmy watch? Never!\"<PARAGRAPH>When Fix tells him that his watch then will not \nagree with the sun, he replies in a typical stubborn French vein - \"So much \nthe worse for the sun, monsieur. The sun will be wrong, then!\"<PARAGRAPH>The \nwords of Passepartout that convince Fix that Fogg is indeed the robber are as \nfollows in the conversation between them-\"You left London hastily, then?\"<PARAGRAPH>\"I rather think so! Last Friday at eight o'clock in the evening, \nMonsieur Fogg came home from his club, and three-quarters of an hour afterwards \nwe were off.\"<PARAGRAPH>\"But where is your master going?\" \"Always \nstraight-ahead. He is going round the world.\" \"Round the world?\" \ncried Fix.<PARAGRAPH>\"Yes, and in eighty days! He says it is on a wager; but, \nbetween us, I don't believe a word of it. That wouldn't be common sense. There's \nsomething else in the wind.\"<PARAGRAPH>\"Ah! Mr. Fogg is a character, is \nhe?\" \"I should say he was.\"<PARAGRAPH>\"Is he rich?\" \"No \ndoubt, for he is carrying an enormous sum in brand new banknotes with him. And \nhe doesn't spare the money on the way, either: he has offered a large reward to \nthe engineer of the Mongolia if he gets us to Bombay well in advance of time.\"<PARAGRAPH>\"And you have known your master a long time?\" \"Why, no; \nI entered his service the very day we left London.\"<PARAGRAPH>Jules Verne manages \nto show how coincidences and convenient assumptions lead to false conclusions. \nAfter hearing Passepartout talk about Fogg, Fix hastily assumes that Fogg and \nnone else could be the robber. Fogg's story does sound a little fishy but as we \nlearn for a fact later, Fogg is a gentleman and certainly not a robber. Fix on \nthe other hand is not too popular with the readers. We do not like his presumptuous \nair and his questionable ways of obtaining information. He is obviously using \nthe innocent and extremely likeable Passepartout.<PARAGRAPH>After the conversation \nwith Passepartout, Fix goes back to the Consul with the conviction that he has \nfound his robber. \"Consul,\" said he, \"I have no longer any doubt. \nI have spotted my man. He passes himself off as an odd stick who is going round \nthe world in eighty days.\" \"Then he's a sharp fellow,\" returned \nthe consul, \"and counts on returning to London after putting the police of \nthe two countries off his track.\" \"We'll see about that,\" replied \nFix.<PARAGRAPH>\"But are you not mistaken?\" \"I am not mistaken.\"<PARAGRAPH>\"Why was this robber so anxious to prove, by the visa, that he had \npassed through Suez?\" \"Why? I have no idea; but listen to me.\" \nThis chapter ends with Fix sure in the feeling that he will get a warrant for \nFogg's arrest and will catch hold of him in India. He too gets aboard the Mongolia, \nwith the thought of keeping a tab on Fogg's movements.<PARAGRAPH>Jules Verne proceeds \nat a fast pace. No one episode is dwelt upon for too long. There is constant progression \nin the story and the reader never gets a chance to complain of boredom. The chapters \nare short and succeed in giving the required scenario; no more, no less.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141554/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Around_The_World_In_80_Days/Around_The_World_In_Eighty_Days13.html"}
