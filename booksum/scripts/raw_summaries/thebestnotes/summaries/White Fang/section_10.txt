{"name": "chapter 3", "summary": "White Fang\u0092s fights \nwith Lip-lip continue to rage as furiously as ever. He makes a reputation for \nhimself as being the most wicked dog in camp. He can also snarl more terribly \nthan any other dog, a skill he uses to his advantage. Both humans and animals \nhate him. He is always mixed up in squabbles over stolen meat. He is also totally \non his own, for no dog ever backs him. White Fang, however, never hesitates to \nleave his teeth marks on any of the other dogs. In fact, he learns to fight very \neffectively and efficiently, even when he is outnumbered. He also learns to attack \nwithout warning, catching his enemy off guard. One day he kills one of the camp \ndogs on the edge of the woods. Gray Beaver refuses to listen to the protests of \nIndians over the killing. White Fang is his dog.<PARAGRAPH>Because of White Fang\u0092s \nferocity, no dog is left alone, for fear of his attacks. His favorite trick is \nto lose his trail in the water, hide from his enemy, and attack in a surprising \nmanner. Although the strength of the pack lies in its size, White Fang manages \nto gain the upper hand. The dogs know that he can kill the leader of a pack before \nthe other dogs arrive. By this point he has learned to obey the strong and oppress \nthe weak.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025238/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/White_Fang/White_Fang16.html"}
