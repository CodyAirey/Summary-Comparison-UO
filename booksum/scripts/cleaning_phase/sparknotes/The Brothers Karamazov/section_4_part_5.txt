{"name": "book 4, Chapter 5", "summary": "PARAGRAPH>Chapter 5: Strain in the Drawing-Room  Alyosha goes upstairs to talk to Ivan and Katerina. To Alyosha's eyes, Ivan and Katerina are obviously in love, but they torment one another and themselves by inventing moral barriers to keep them apart. Katerina tells Alyosha that she intends to stay loyal to Dmitri, even if he decides to abandon her and marry Grushenka. Ivan says that he thinks her commitment to Dmitri is the right decision. Frustrated, Alyosha tries to make them see that they are only hurting themselves by refusing to acknowledge their love for one another. Ivan admits that he loves Katerina, but says that he thinks she needs to have Dmitri in her life. He says that he has decided to leave for Moscow the next day, and says good-bye. After Ivan leaves, Katerina tells Alyosha a story about an old captain who once provoked Dmitri's wrath. Dmitri beat him badly in front of the captain's young son, who begged him to spare his father. Katerina asks Alyosha to take 200 rubles to the captain to help make up for Dmitri's violence, and Alyosha agrees", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210305110438/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/brothersk/section5/"}
