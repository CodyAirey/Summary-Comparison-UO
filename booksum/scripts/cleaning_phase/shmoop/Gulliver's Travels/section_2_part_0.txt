{"name": "Part 1, Chapter 3", "summary": "The Lilliputian court comes to like Gulliver thanks to his gentle behavior.<PARAGRAPH>Because the Emperor admires Gulliver so much, the Emperor orders his people to put on a couple of shows for Gulliver<PARAGRAPH>The main show is a kind of rope dancing, which is performed only by people who hold high office in Lilliput. In fact, in order to get a high office in Lilliput, you have to beat all the other candidates in this rope dancing competition. Skill at this dance is the main qualification for court positions.<PARAGRAPH>Because the dance involves seeing who can jump the highest on a piece of rope without falling, there are lots of accidents. People try to jump too high or miss the rope and whatnot - and some of these falls are even fatal.<PARAGRAPH>The Emperor also likes to make his court play a kind of limbo. Sometimes his courtiers creep under a stick he's holding and sometimes they jump over. Whoever jumps and crawls the best wins a prize from the emperor: a colored belt, like a karate belt, proving the winner's skills.<PARAGRAPH>Gulliver invents a game to entertain the emperor: he sets up a raised stage using his handkerchief and a set of sticks.<PARAGRAPH>On this stage, he sets a troop of 24 of the Emperor's horsemen to perform their maneuvers and drills.<PARAGRAPH>This game goes on until one of the horses tears through the handkerchief with its hoof and injures itself; after that, Gulliver decides the handkerchief is too weak to support the Lilliputians.<PARAGRAPH>As Gulliver gets busy entertaining the Emperor's court, he hears news that something else has washed ashore: a giant black thing that doesn't seem like a living creature.<PARAGRAPH>It is, in fact, Gulliver's hat, which the Lilliputians drag to the capital. Gulliver is happy to get it back again.<PARAGRAPH>The Emperor  decides that he wants Gulliver to pose standing with his legs as far apart as they can go.<PARAGRAPH>The Emperor orders his troops to march between Gulliver's legs in rows of 24 men.<PARAGRAPH>Even though the Emperor also tells his armies not to make any comments about Gulliver's body, a bunch of them can't help looking up and laughing.<PARAGRAPH>Gulliver's pants are in such tatters at this point that he's flashing all of the Emperor's armies. There are, he tells us, \"opportunities for laughter and admiration\"  for the Lilliputians - after all, Gulliver implies, he's a giant, and his penis has to be proportionally huge.<PARAGRAPH>Gulliver lobbies hard to be set free, and finally the whole court agrees, with one exception: Skyresh Bolgolam, who seems to feel he is Gulliver's enemy .<PARAGRAPH>Bolgolam at last agrees that Gulliver should be released, but only if Bolgolam can make the conditions for Gulliver's freedom.<PARAGRAPH>The contract for Gulliver's freedom has the following rules:Gulliver won't leave Lilliput without permission;He won't come into the main city without the Emperor's permission and two hours of notice ;The \"man-mountain,\" as they continue to call him, will only walk on the kingdom's main roads, and will not lie down in any meadows or fields;He will be careful not to stomp on anyone or pick them up without their consent;Once a month, if there are particularly urgent messages the Emperor wants to send, Gulliver will have to carry the messenger and his horse to his destination and back again;Gulliver will defend Lilliput against their enemy, the island of Blefuscu;He will help workmen pick up stones to build walls and royal buildings;In two months' time, Gulliver will give the Emperor his calculation of how big the island of Lilliput is;If Gulliver observes all of these rules, the Emperor will provide Gulliver with food, drink, and \"access to our royal person\"  - in other words, Gulliver will get to spend as much time as he wants with the Emperor.
