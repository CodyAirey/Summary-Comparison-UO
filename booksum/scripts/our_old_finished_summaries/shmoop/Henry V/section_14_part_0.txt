He's been sentenced to death for looting. Pistol begs Captain Fluellen to intercede on Bardolph's behalf. When Fluellen says that Bardolph deserves to be punished, Pistol throws a tantrum and makes an obscene hand gesture called a \"fig\" , which involves pushing his thumb between two fingers. Fluellen is unimpressed. Just then, Gower recognizes who Pistol is and chimes in that Pistol is nothing more than a \"bawd and a cutpurse\" . He says that guys like Pistol are a dime a dozen in times of war. They show up at the battlefield and talk a lot of smack without ever actually doing anything. Then, they go home from war and brag to everyone about how brave they were. King Henry arrives with his exhausted soldiers in tow. Fluellen proudly reports that the English have taken over an important French bridge, which he calls a \"pridge.\" When Henry finds out that his old pal Bardolph has been busted for looting a local Church, he declares that any other English soldiers caught stealing or abusing the French villagers will be hanged, period. Montjoy enters with a message from the French king: \"Though we seemed dead, we did but sleep.\" King Henry asks Montjoy to deliver a message to King Charles: Even though the English army is exhausted and sickly, the French better watch their backs because they're not going to back down. Henry tips the enemy messenger and sends him on his way.", "analysis": ""}
