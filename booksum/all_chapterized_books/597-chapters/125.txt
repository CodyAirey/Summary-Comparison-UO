125. FLOSI'S JOURNEY FROM HOME

Flosi busked him from the east when two months were still to
winter, and summoned to him all his men who had promised him help
and company.  Each of them had two horses and good weapons, and
they all came to Swinefell, and were there that night.

Flosi made them say prayers betimes on the Lord's day, and
afterwards they sate down to meat.  He spoke to his household,
and told them what work each was to do while he was away.  After
that he went to his horses.

Flosi and his men rode first west on the Sand (1).  Flosi bade
them not to ride too hard at first; but said they would do well
enough at that pace, and he bade all to wait for the others if
any of them had need to stop.  They rode west to Woodcombe, and
came to Kirkby.  Flosi there bade all men to come into the
church, and pray to God, and men did so.

After that they mounted their horses, and rode on the fell, and
so to Fishwaters, and rode a little to the west of the lakes, and
so struck down west on to the Sand (2).  Then they left Eyjafell
Jokul on their left hand, and so came down into Godaland, and so
on to Markfleet, and came about nones (3) on the second day of
the week to Threecorner ridge, and waited till mid-even.  Then
all had came thither save Ingialld of the Springs.

The sons of Sigfus spoke much ill of him, but Flosi bade them not
blame Ingialld when he was not by, "But we will pay him for this
hereafter."
