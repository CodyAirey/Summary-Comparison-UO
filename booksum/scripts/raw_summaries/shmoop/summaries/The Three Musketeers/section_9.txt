Then he tells them the whole story while they sip the wine. D\u2019Artagnan is all excited that a woman is involved.<PARAGRAPH>The friends talk about the Queen and the Duke for a little bit, and decide that although he is English, the Duke of Buckingham is still a fine man and they too would be interested in the Queen, given the chance.<PARAGRAPH>Porthos in particular admires the Duke\u2019s fashion sense.<PARAGRAPH>The friends decide that angering the Cardinal is always the best course of action, even if it means helping the Queen cheat on the King.<PARAGRAPH>Aramis then has a story to tell. It starts off perfectly innocent\u2014he was visiting a learned man. Then we learn that the man has a niece.<PARAGRAPH>Aramis escorted the niece to her carriage, when the man from Meung, along with a couple other men, accosted the two of them and addressed Aramis as the Duke.<PARAGRAPH>Clearly the man from Meung mistook Aramis for the Duke of Buckingham, and the niece for the Queen.<PARAGRAPH>Porthos expresses astonishment at the story, pointing out that a Musketeer\u2019s clothes are rather visible.<PARAGRAPH>Aramis confesses that he was wearing a giant coat.
