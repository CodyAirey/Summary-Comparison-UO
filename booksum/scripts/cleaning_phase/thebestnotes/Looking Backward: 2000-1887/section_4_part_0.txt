{"name": "chapter iv", "summary": "Feeling faint, Julian is led inside and given some wine and food by \n        the doctor. He admits that he now believes that this is not a joke. The \n        two men introduce themselves. The doctors name is Leete. Doctor Leete \n        lets Julian West bathe and change clothes. Julian West finds himself less \n        preoccupied with his former life and intensely curious about his new world. \n        When he gets dressed, he asks to go back upstairs to see the city. He \n        and Doctor Leete sit up there in easy chairs and discuss the changes that \n        have occurred. Julian West notices some differences between the old Boston \n        and the new: the lack of chimneys, and more significantly, the atmosphere \n        of prosperity. Doctor Leete attributes the lack of prosperity in Julian \n        Wests day to the inefficiency of the industrial system, excessive individualism, \n        and the concentration of wealth in private hands. He tells Julian West \n        that at present, all surplus wealth goes to the adornment of the city, \n        something everyone can enjoy.<PARAGRAPH>Doctor Leete takes him downstairs to meet his wife and daughter. Mrs. \n        Leete is a fine-looking woman and Edith Leete is beautiful and healthy. \n        That evening he has a wonderful time talking to the Leetes. Their conversation \n        is honest and straightforward. Julian West feels almost intoxicated. He \n        notices Edith Leete looking at him with great curiosity. They all discuss \n        how he came to be left in his underground chamber. The house seems to \n        have caught fire and burned down the night he fell asleep. Sawyer was \n        probably killed in the flames. No one excavated the house, and so his \n        underground room was not discovered. The site of the house had remained \n        a vacant lot for at least a half a century.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025235/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Looking_Backward_Bellamy/Looking_Backward_Study_Guide07.html"}
