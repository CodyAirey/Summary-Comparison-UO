Dr. Kemp is in his study overlooking the town of Burdock. Kemp's study is full of science stuff, which explains why he's looking out the window: who wants to look at all that science stuff? So, looking out his window, Kemp sees a man with a shabby high hat running down into town. Kemp thinks this might just be another fool who is afraid of the Invisible Man. Kemp, of course, is too scientific to believe in an Invisible Man. But outside, the running man looks terrified. Everyone around freaks out, and for good reason: the Invisible Man is chasing after the running man.", "analysis": ""}
