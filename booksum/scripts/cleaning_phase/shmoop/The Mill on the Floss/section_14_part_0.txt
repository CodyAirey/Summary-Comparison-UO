{"name": "Book 2, Chapter 2", "summary": "The narrator describes how the Tulliver house is very cheery at Christmastime.<PARAGRAPH>But Tom notices that something seems a little off.<PARAGRAPH>Turns out that Mr. Tulliver is in a terrible mood. Some man in the neighborhood, a Mr. Privart, is trying some new irrigation techniques and it's interfering with Tulliver's Mill, which runs on water power.<PARAGRAPH>This new guy is also a client of Mr. Wakem, the evil lawyer.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Tulliver keeps ranting and Mr. and Mrs. Moss are confused by the whole thing.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Tulliver announces that he'll make Tom an engineer so that he can figure out this irrigation business. Tom is rather alarmed by that announcement. He thought he'd run a mill just like his dad.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Moss and Mrs. Tulliver agree that getting involved in lawsuits is a bad idea and they hope Mr. Tulliver won't do it.<PARAGRAPH>, which is all about a legal case over a disputed will that lasts for decades.)<PARAGRAPH>We learn that Mr. Tulliver has a history of getting involved in lawsuits and legal disputes. Mr. Tulliver's own lawyer, Mr. Gore, isn't really the best of lawyers. He actually sounds a bit like Barry, the world's worst lawyer, from Arrested Development. Mr. Wakem is unfortunately a superstar lawyer, albeit an evil one.<PARAGRAPH>At the end of his holidays Tom tells his dad that he heard a rumor: apparently Mr. Wakem is sending his son to study with Mr. Stelling.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Tulliver says it's true and tells Tom to be nice to the son since he's deformed. He says that Mr. Wakem obviously thinks Mr. Stelling is a good teacher, so it's all cool really.<PARAGRAPH>Tom is not looking forward to meeting a deformed Wakem.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210619215702/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/mill-on-the-floss/summary/book-2-chapter-2"}
